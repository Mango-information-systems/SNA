NLP was not created for academic study or intellectual analysis. To know NLP is to short change yourself if you are not skilled enough to use it. To talk about NLP is still missing the point \u2013 you can only discover its power by trying it out. So the next time you catch yourself talking about NLP, <strong>stop</strong>. Practise what it is you are talking about and see how this changes your experience. That\u2019s what NLP was designed for \u2013 to give you choice and control over your life experiences \u2013 to be at cause rather than effect.\"</em> ~ David Molden, Best-selling NLP Author and Trainer</p>\n<p><em>In effect, in every day use, learning has come to be synonymous with \"taking in information\". \"Yes, I learned all about that at the training yesterday\".

Yet, just like any other Meetup group there are some rules to observe.</p>\n<p>1. By signing up you acknowledge being an expat or a Belgian with an international background (e.g. have lived abroad, doing a lot of international business, avid traveller, foreign spouse etc). Fake profiles or people who are not a member for the right reasons will be deleted immediately.</p>\n<p>2. You must RSVP when you joining our events.\u00a0 We have to know how many people will show up to make proper reservations.\u00a0 Equally important, you must change your RSVP status if you cannot make it anymore. No-shows are a real problem for us, and we keep track of your attendance history and may delete you from our list if you are a regular no-shower.</p>\n<p>3. Respect other members.\u00a0 Further explanation is unnecessary, although you may want to know we have a (near) zero-tolerance policy.</p>\n<p><strong>Legal structure:</strong> Expat Club is a professional service of Xross Global Group BVBA (VAT registration number BE 0501.838.210).

Hence, we particularly encourage women, people with disabilities and people of colour to participate.<br>\n\n - Are you an experienced debater? Drop us an email. We are always keen to welcome competent fellows on board.</p>\n<p><br>\n\nHow much is it?<br>\n\n - The training and the debates are free of charge.

Following it's success in becoming one of the city's fastest growing groups, we have launched TechMeetups communities in the following locations:</p>\n<p>Europe: <a href=\"http://techmeetups.com/london/\">London</a>, <a href=\"http://techmeetups.com/berlin\">Berlin</a>, <a href=\"http://techmeetups.com/cambridge/\">Cambridge</a>, <a href=\"http://techmeetups.com/lisbon/\">Lisbon</a>, <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/moscow-techmeetups/\">Moscow</a>, <a href=\"http://techmeetups.com/manchester/\">Manchester</a>, <a href=\"http://techmeetups.com/paris/\">Paris</a>, <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/budapest-TechMeetups/\">Budapest</a>, <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/belgrade-techmeetups\">Belgrade</a>, <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Amsterdam-TechMeetups/\">Amsterdam</a>, <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Stockholm-TechMeetups/events/113641142/\">Stockholm</a>, <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Dublin-TechMeetups/\">Dublin</a>, <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/munich-TechMeetups/\">Munich</a>, <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Edinburgh-TechMeetups/\">Edinburgh</a>, <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Hamburg-TechMeetups/\">Hamburg</a>, <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Vienna-TechMeetups/\">Vienna</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/barcelona-techmeetups\">Barcelona</a></p>\n<p>USA: <a href=\"http://techmeetups.com/newyork/\">New York</a>, <a href=\"http://techmeetups.com/dallas/\">Dallas</a>, <a href=\"http://techmeetups.com/miami/\">Miami</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://techmeetups.com/sanfrancisco/\">San Francisco</a></p>\n<p>Asia: <a href=\"http://techmeetups.com/bangalore/\">Bangalore</a>, <a href=\"http://techmeetups.com/bangkok/\">Bangkok</a>, <a href=\"http://techmeetups.com/bangkok/\">Mumbai</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://techmeetups.com/singapore/\">Singapore</a></p>\n<p>Others : <a href=\"http://techmeetups.com/dubai/\">Dubai</a>, <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/sydney-techmeetups\">Sydney</a>, <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/rio-techmeetup\">Rio De Janeiro</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/SaoPaulo-TechMeetups/\">Sao Paulo</a></p>\n<br>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/SaoPaulo-TechMeetups/\"></a>\n<p>You can see our latest list of communities <a href=\"http://techmeetups.com/communities/\">here</a>.</p>\n<br>\n\n<p>\u2022\u00a0<b>Why become a member of TechMeetups?</b></p>\n<p>Anyone who is thinking about starting their own software or web company and wants to bounce ideas off each other and meet potential partners or investors are welcome to join this group!</p>\n<p>Our aim is to connect the various tech communities to help our members network, connect, invest and launch products in the hottest technology clusters.

Using structured exercises that have been tried and tested by thousands of people around the globe we will experience our very own mindfulness in motion.

This group is for you if you answer \u2018YES\u2019 to any of the following questions: Do you have a really quick mind, always thinking about lots of things, and you\u2019d like to find that place of calm and stillness that other people seem to have?

We are looking for anyone able to express him/herself in English, French or Dutch.</p>\n<p>You don't play an instrument yourself, but you know people who do? Inform them about this opportunity. They will be grateful!</p>\n<p>Are you available to help organizing the band? Please indicate so when joining, so we can gather to get this band running.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile? Just start dreaming! You could soon be playing in a band like this one: (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9_bjats2x4\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9_bjats2x4</a> )</p>\n<p><br>\n\n</p>\n<p><b>Nederlands:</b></p>\n<p>Belgi\u00eb heeft een rijke traditie aan harmonieorkesten. Desondanks kent Brussel er slechts weinig. Deze groep heeft als doel het verzamelen van muzikanten die wensen te spelen in een nieuw harmonieorkest in Brussel, dat zo vroeg mogelijk wenst te starten. Het doel van de harmonie is om regelmatige repetities te houden om zo tot het geven van podium- en straatconcerten over te kunnen gaan.</p>\n<p>Speelt u een instrument? U speelt reeds in een groep/orkest en je wenst meer? Of misschien heb je een instrument bespeeld toen je jonger was en nu wens je opnieuw te beginnen? Waarom niet lid worden van deze groep om bij deze harmonie te spelen vanaf we genoeg leden hebben?</p>\n<p>Of u nu altijd in Brussel gewoond hebt, je voor het werk naar Brussel werd overgeplaatst, je studeert in Brussel, of werkt in Brussel om iedere avond naar huis terug te keren: wordt lid van deze groep zodat we contact met je kunnen opnemen! We zijn op zoek naar iedereen die zich kan uitdrukken in het Nederlands, Engels of het Frans.</p>\n<p>U speelt zelf geen instrument, maar u kent mensen die dat wel doen? Informeer hen over dit initiatief. Ze zullen u dankbaar zijn!</p>\n<p>Bent u beschikbaar om het harmonieorkest te helpen organiseren? Gelieve dit aan de duiden wanneer u lid wordt van de groep, zodat we kunnen afspreken om deze harmonie op te starten.</p>\n<p>En ondertussen? Begin maar alvast te dromen! U zou binnenkort in een harmonie als deze kunnen spelen: (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9_bjats2x4\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9_bjats2x4</a>\u00a0)</p>\n<b><br>\n\n</b>\n<p><b>Fran\u00e7ais:</b></p>\n<p>La Belgique a une tradition riche quant aux fanfares et des harmonies.

Feel free to unsubscribe if you think I only do this to get rich quick ;-).</p>\n<p>I am also not using the +1 option anymore; if you want friends to come along, they can become Meetup members (as you know this is free). I have had too many bad experiences with careless people and their friends.<br>\n\n</p>\n<p>No-shows: I expect everybody who RSVP's to come along to show a minimum of involvment and interest. I mean by this: CHECK the site regularly for updates to the activity, as an organiser I can see when this does not happen, and I reserve the right to remove you from the active list if I suspect you will not show up and you do not reply to messages I send you.<br>\n\n</p>\n<p>If you do actually not show up and fail completely to explain yourself to me either through a phonecall or mail I will ban you from my section of the site and report you to Meetup.</p>\n<p>On the day of the activity you cannot reach me anymore through the site (I do not own a smartphone), I always share my phone number so THIS is the way to contact me. The group cannot wait for people who are late in the morning when we are dependent on public transport.<br>\n\n</p>\n<p>In this group I'm trying to get together likeminded people who want to enjoy the outdoors at a leisurely pace. Objective is to go walking or cycling, mainly half- (late fall/winter when it gets dark early) or one-day-events on weekends, but weekdays are possible too when they are on holidays.<br>\n\n</p>\n<p>Here and there I might smuggle in a little culture, like a museum or a local landmark.<br>\n\n</p>\n<p>For walking I'm thinking of keeping it at a distance of around 20 km, I don't believe in doing distances just for the sake of doing long\u00a0 distances and then in the end having to run for the last train, I go out of my front door to have fun, not to prove anything to myself or anyone else. If you want to do 40 km or more there are other groups (and treadmills) you can use.</p>\n<p>I have a certain pace (3-4 km/h while walking) which I think is not exaggerated. If you want to walk faster than this, I suggest you find another group; I will NEVER speed up for you from my comfortable pace, you might end up waiting at every corner or taking a very late train back because you thought you could find the way all by yourself and we lost sight of each other. I do not go back and search for anyone, but I will slow down for people who have difficulties towards the end of the walk, I don't leave people behind who have misjudged themselves a little bit.<br>\n\n</p>\n<p>Cycling could be up to 100 km (mainly flat terrain like canals and old railway lines in Flanders and Wallonia). I do not own a racing bike nor do I drive at racing speeds...The objective is to have fun and meet friendly people from all walks of life. I am based in Mechelen but make use of the relatively good public transport system to go all over the place, I have access to a car as well so carsharing may be an option. Input of others is encouraged and appreciated!<br>\n\n</p>\n<blockquote>When mapping out longer tracks I'll also TRY to include short-cuts (railway/bus stations along the way) for people who would like to have options, of course this is not always possible and I will not cut the walk short for myself and people who will do the full walk; a smartphone with GPS is a handy instrument if you are unsure you can finish the complete activity, as is a printed version (zoomed in enough) of the Routeyou-map I will always provide.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n<p>I'd also like to add that I don't mean to have this be a family-oriented thing, at least the trips I do myself. Couples and friends who already know one another are more than welcome to come along on activities but no kids please, anyone can use my account though to plan their own activities...</p>\n<p><b>A few links to get people started on their own trips:</b></p>\n<p>Cycling-network in Flanders,Holland and small part of Wallonia: <a href=\"http://fietsnet.be/routeplanner/default.aspx\">http://fietsnet.be/routeplanner...</a>\u00ad<br>\n\n</p>\n<p>Cycling on the RAVEL (wallonia): <a href=\"http://ravel.wallonie.be/opencms/opencms/fr\">http://ravel.wallonie.be/opencm...</a>\u00ad (I know I know it's only in French, blame them not me :-p)</p>\n<p>Free BASECAMP map program from GARMIN<br>\n\n <a>http://www8.garmin.com/support/...</a>\u00ad</p>\n<p>Free BENELUX topographic map to use in BASECAMP (this is a volunteers' project and sometimes automatic routing doesn't work properly)<br>\n\n <a href=\"http://www.openfietsmap.nl/downloads\">http://www.openfietsmap.nl/down...</a>\u00ad</p>\n<p>Walking networks in Flanders (except Limburg, they would not co-operate...): <a href=\"http://www.wandelknooppunt.be/\">http://www.wandelknooppunt.be/</a>\u00ad</p>\nROUTEYOU: also lets you build all kinds of routes on different map styles online for free<br>\n\n \n<p><a href=\"http://www.routeyou.com\">www.routeyou.com</a><br>\n\n</p>\n</blockquote>", "join_mode": "open", "country": "BE", "topics": [{"id": 579, "urlkey": "bike", "name": "Bicycling"}, {"id": 638, "urlkey": "hiking", "name": "Hiking"}, {"id": 933, "urlkey": "walkers", "name": "Walking"}, {"id": 17259, "urlkey": "road-cycling", "name": "Road Cycling"}, {"id": 18617, "urlkey": "cycling", "name": "Cycling"}, {"id": 20266, "urlkey": "mountain-biking", "name": "Mountain Biking"}, {"id": 54921, "urlkey": "social-cycling", "name": "Social Cycling"}, {"id": 97022, "urlkey": "cycling-groups", "name": "Cycling Groups"}, {"id": 136553, "urlkey": "walking-group", "name": "Walking group"}, {"id": 338951, "urlkey": "social-road-cycling", "name": "Social Road Cycling"}, {"id": 559912, "urlkey": "walking-hiking-cycling", "name": "Walking & hiking & cycling"}], "who": "People", "lon": 4.46999979019165, "visibility": "public_limited", "created": 1397252699000, "link": "http://www.meetup.com/Belgian-walking-cycling-daytrips/", "members": 247, "urlname": "Belgian-walking-cycling-daytrips", "lat": 51.029998779296875, "timezone": "Europe/Brussels", "organizer": {"name": "Sven", "member_id": 141507192}, "id": 13863032, "name": "Belgian walking and cycling daytrips"}, {"category": {"shortname": "music", "id": 21, "name": "music"}, "city": "Brussels", "rating": 0, "description": "<p>Hi all!

If sucessful this would mean the live in artists would only have to pay a maximum low 'symbolic' rent</p>\n<p>PLACE: Wherever/ New York, New Delhi, London, Lisbon, Berlin ???</p>\n<p>Blog 1: Let's open another Chill Out Art House : ) !! <a href=\"http://www.ChillOutCommunityArtsHouse.blogspot.com\">www.ChillOutCommunityArtsHouse.blogspot.com</a> \u00a0</p>\n<p>Blog 2: Lisbon Chill Out Art House &gt; Jan. - Dec. 2012 <a>www.chilloutarthouse.blogspot.be</a></p>\n<p>FcBk : <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/ChillOutCommunityArts99\">www.facebook.com/ChillOutCommunityArts99</a></p>\n<p>email: chilloutcommunityartshouse@gmail.com</p>\n<p>phone: 0488 25 36 09</p>\n<p>skype: <a href=\"mailto:drawing4every1everywhere@gmail.com\">drawing4every1everywhere</a></p>\n<p>Love, Peace, Art and Hugs</p>\n<p><br>\n\n</p>\n<p><br>\n\n</p>", "join_mode": "open", "country": "BE", "topics": [{"id": 1502, "urlkey": "art", "name": "Live Music"}, {"id": 2784, "urlkey": "figuredrawing", "name": "Figure Drawing"}, {"id": 16389, "urlkey": "fine-arts", "name": "Fine Arts"}, {"id": 16783, "urlkey": "sketching", "name": "Sketching"}, {"id": 16784, "urlkey": "painting", "name": "Painting"}, {"id": 19349, "urlkey": "models-for-figure-drawing", "name": "Models for Figure Drawing"}, {"id": 20805, "urlkey": "draw", "name": "Drawing"}, {"id": 23981, "urlkey": "life-drawing", "name": "Life Drawing"}, {"id": 25222, "urlkey": "drawing-pencil-charcoal-pen-and-ink-markers", "name": "Drawing - Pencil, Charcoal, Pen and Ink, Markers"}, {"id": 30076, "urlkey": "free-hand-drawing", "name": "Free-hand Drawing"}, {"id": 36229, "urlkey": "creative", "name": "Creativity"}, {"id": 59449, "urlkey": "fine-art-drawing", "name": "Fine Art Drawing"}, {"id": 67460, "urlkey": "charcoal-drawing", "name": "Charcoal Drawing"}, {"id": 70053, "urlkey": "drawing-for-fun", "name": "Drawing for Fun"}, {"id": 87468, "urlkey": "drawing-from-the-model", "name": "Drawing from the Model"}, {"id": 92988, "urlkey": "figure-drawing-workshops", "name": "Figure Drawing Workshops"}, {"id": 105191, "urlkey": "life-figure-drawing", "name": "Life Figure Drawing"}], "who": "Community Artists", "lon": 4.329999923706055, "visibility": "public", "created": 1400147635000, "group_photo": {"thumb_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/c/8/thumb_363667112.jpeg", "photo_id": 363667112, "photo_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/c/8/600_363667112.jpeg", "highres_link": "http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/b/c/8/highres_363667112.jpeg"}, "link": "http://www.meetup.com/CommunityArtsHouse/", "members": 7, "urlname": "CommunityArtsHouse", "lat": 50.83000183105469, "timezone": "Europe/Brussels", "organizer": {"name": "David Meehan", "member_id": 109585532}, "id": 14468202, "name": "Chill Out Community Art House"}, {"category": {"shortname": "dancing", "id": 5, "name": "dancing"}, "city": "Brussels", "rating": 5, "description": "<p>Hi Everyone,</p>\n<p>Thanks for checking out our group.

We call this approach PsychoSpirituality, as it removes the ego/psychological blocks to the awareness of our spiritual Truth, constantly bringing us back to The One Question: do I choose to join with the Higher Self or with the ego?</p>\n<p>Our mental understanding of the metaphysical truth often doesn\u2019t turn into an authentic experience because of the presence of deep unconscious beliefs. Uncovering and healing these beliefs is one of the aim of these gatherings, along with the teachings received from the Voice of the Higher Self throughout the session. The participants are given the opportunity to work on their personal issues, or to witness others going through the process. As the core unconscious beliefs are shared by the one ego, the healing that comes from the Higher Self happens for all of us \u2013 we are never healed alone.</p>\n<p><b>Intensive gatherings with deep teachings and personal healing:</b></p>\n<p>Starting with real life situations brought by the participants, related teachings are received through the Voice of the Higher Self, allowing us to recognize what is really going on in the mind beyond the veil of the ego layers. We then apply a healing method to release what was identified as illusions and blocks to the truth.Witnessing the process during the gatherings allows the participants to utilize this practical healing method in their everyday life.<br>\n\n</p>\n<p><b>What is PsychoSpirituality?</b></p>\n<p>\"\nThe whole idea of PsychoSpirituality as we see it, is to transcend what is done in a psychological approach, to transcend what seems to be psychological.\n The psychological aspect of it is just something to deal with clearing away the clutter to get to the point where we can reach the spiritual truth, and realize that it has already happened, it\u2019s already there. \nIt seems that we think about what appears to be a psychological issue, it seems that we do techniques that revolve around it, but really, it\u2019s about connecting first at a deeper level, keeping that in mind while we are going through the other aspects of it. That\u2019s the spiritual aspect that permeates the whole process. No matter what it looks like that we are doing in form, we are still always coming back to the joining with the Spirit, the True Self, joining with the truth of What we are.\n\u00a0</p>\n<p>Whereas psychology deals with duality and helps make duality better and more tolerable, with PsychoSpirituality we focus of the pure truth of Oneness after we are dealing with the idea of the illusion of separateness. \nAt the Spirit level, the True Self level, there is nothing to do but to accept Oneness. But in form, we apply these psychospiritual techniques to facilitate the furtherance of the acceptance of the spiritual aspect.\n Acceptance is easier when we dig through the debris of the mind that obscures the validity of the essence of our being. Just merely stating the truth does help the people at times, but sometimes, taking an active stance and effort towards digging through the lies of the illusion can help facilitate the acceptance of Oneness.\n</p>\n<p>The focus of this approach is really Oneness, but the psychological aspect is put in service of realizing the oneness of What we are.\n And because it\u2019s put in service of it with the energy the force and the will of Oneness behind it, it\u2019s not like regular psychology, it\u2019s not even close. \nWe\u2019re working from the other side of it, we are not standing on the side of duality, working back and hoping to get to Oneness. We stand on the side of Oneness, undoing the idea and the effects of duality, approaching it from the opposite side, because of the very nature of how we are doing it. \n</p>\n<p>Psychology attempts to do something ; what we are doing is no attempt, it\u2019s coming from a place of truth that is not speculative. There\u2019s no argument : Oneness is Oneness. \nThat is where we are coming from, and we are helping the mind, the aspects of our mind that appear like other people, to realize that there are no other people, to work through the imaginary problems. Instead of being totally fixated inside of the problem, we are doing what Einstein talked about, we are going to a different level to solve the imaginary problem. \nIt\u2019s beautiful and elegant in its idea and its approach, and it doesn\u2019t requires anybody to believe in the methodology of it, it just works because it cannot not work, because it is what it is. Eventually, the mind is pulled out of the illusion, and we proceed from there.\" <i>Ken Kelly</i>\u00a0</p>\n<p><b>Who should join?</b></p>\n<p>This is a practical group combining teachings and personal healing. We invite you to bring the difficulties you are facing in your life when you are stuck in the ego perspective, or your blocks to be the Love you really are.\u00a0<span>All is needed from you is the desire to join with the truth instead of the ego.\u00a0</span><span>We then let the Higher Self guide us to identify the root of these difficulties and showing us the truth beyond these illusions, before releasing them.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Because we constantly refer to the truth of What we really are, it\u2019s useful to have at least a basic knowledge of non dual spiritual approaches (A Course in Miracles, adva\u00efta, Zen, Buddhism, etc.)</p>\n<p>Advanced students of A Course in Miracles or other non dual spiritual paths will find here the opportunity to remove the ego beliefs that prevent them from experiencing what they know to be the truth.</p>\n<p><b>About Ken and Brigitte</b></p>\n<p><b>Ken</b> became aware of his True Nature and experienced Oneness\u00a0at an early age. Raised in a Christian culture, he had been practicing Buddhism for over ten years, which then lead to non-duality. He has been teaching the principles of A Course in Miracles for 16 years. These various\u00a0spiritual practices\u00a0are for him but\u00a0pointers to the\u00a0Truth, which always\u00a0lies beyond any conceptualization. During a period of intensive spiritual practice in 1998, he received an inner\u00a0teaching\u00a0- The One Question - which facilitates the teachings in the spiritual gatherings. \n\n</p>\n<p>Putting his personality (ego) aside, Ken became more and more receptive to hear the 'still small voice' of what can be called the Universal Self, the Higher\u00a0Self, or Spirit. During gatherings, Ken shares the teachings he recieves in this way. As Ken sings in one of His songs: 'I hear the Voice for God in everything I do, and if you still your mind, you will hear it too'.\n\n</p>\n<p>Along with being a spiritual teacher, Ken has had a\u00a0career as a musician, songwriter and music producer. His songs are as inspired as his teachings, and the moment\u00a0he grabs\u00a0his guitar is always anticipated in\u00a0meetings and seminars!</p>\n<p><b>Brigitte</b> felt the call of Truth at an early age. In search of answers, she turned first to science and quantum physics and became a physicist engineer. She then became a psychologist and a psychotherapist, and had a career as a trainer in Therapeutia, the Training Institute of Psychotherapy she founded. Her\u00a0spiritual journey is marked by her\u00a0encounter with A Course in Miracles and Advaita. In 2004, she experienced a spiritual connection that called her to devote her\u00a0life to Self-realization.

Taiji is an Internal Martial Art, which is popular for its beneficial effects on health. Practice of Taiji can be compared to meditation in motion, which optimizes the way you breathe, move and keep your balance. It is a great practice if you wish to relax your body and to concentrate your mind. Mastering martial applications of Taijiquan teaches you to defend yourself skillfully and almost effortlessly. Our teacher and guide is Erik Elsemans, president of YMAA in Belgium (Yang\u2019s Martial Arts Association). He has been studying and practicing Taijiquan since 1996 with Dr. Yang, the founder of YMAA. Erik also practices and teaches Kung Fu, he is a certified YMAA Coach instructor. Starting from September 11th, we have weekly classes on Thursdays, at 18:30 for beginners and at 20:00 for those who has some experience. We have 18 sessions in four months, each session costs \u20ac12 and it lasts 1.5 h. If you have any questions, just send me an email!

Sahaja yoga is a unique method which allows you to get into meditation in a spontaneous way and thus reach a state of balance, well-being and self-knowledge. Meditation is a state of your mind, in which you are fully alert, but free from any thought. Your attention is solid and silent in the present moment. The basis is an extraordinary experience, called 'Self-realization', or the awakening of your spiritual life energy, which grants you the union of your deepest Self with the whole. Entering into the state of meditation or 'thoughtless awareness', for even a few moments every day, transforms all areas of your life : physical, mental, emotional and spiritual; you come in harmony with the world around you and feel less affected by the ups and downs of your everyday life. The quality of your life improves, ever more beautiful characteristics express themselves through your personality. The technique of Sahaja yoga meditation has been developed in 1970 by Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. Her unique method has made immemorial knowledge about meditation and Self-realization accessible to all those who sincerely long for it. Shri Mataji received international recognition for her vision of world peace through inner transformation. What you can learn during the sessions : * meditation, step by step * use simple techniques to balance yourself * discover and improve the working of your energy centers (chakra's) * knowledge about the working of your subtle system : energy centers, energy channels, inner life force (Kundalini) * spiritual background of meditation", "join_mode": "open", "country": "BE", "topics": [{"id": 244, "urlkey": "yoga", "name": "Yoga"}, {"id": 325741, "urlkey": "sahaja-yoga", "name": "sahaja yoga"}], "who": "Members", "lon": 4.699999809265137, "visibility": "public", "created": 1412687665000, "link": "http://www.meetup.com/Sahaja-Yoga-Meetup-Leuven/", "members": 12, "urlname": "Sahaja-Yoga-Meetup-Leuven", "lat": 50.880001068115234, "timezone": "Europe/Brussels", "organizer": {"name": "Katrien Benoit", "member_id": 176339912}, "id": 17459042, "name": "Sahaja Yoga Meetup - Leuven"}, {"category": {"shortname": "career-business", "id": 2, "name": "career/business"}, "city": "Brussels", "rating": 0, "description": "Monthly meetups to talk about how online marketing.", "join_mode": "open", "country": "BE", "topics": [{"id": 15585, "urlkey": "online-marketing", "name": "Online Marketing"}, {"id": 17325, "urlkey": "small-business-marketing-strategy", "name": "Small Business Marketing Strategy"}, {"id": 17742, "urlkey": "social-media-marketing", "name": "Social Media Marketing"}, {"id": 23199, "urlkey": "seo-search-engine-optimization", "name": "SEO (Search Engine Optimization)"}, {"id": 84796, "urlkey": "small-business-online-marketing", "name": "Small Business Online Marketing"}, {"id": 778462, "urlkey": "online-marketing-for-small-business", "name": "Online Marketing For Small Business"}], "who": "Online Marketers", "lon": 4.329999923706055, "visibility": "public", "created": 1412755935000, "link": "http://www.meetup.com/Online-Marketers-Belgium/", "members": 12, "urlname": "Online-Marketers-Belgium", "lat": 50.83000183105469, "timezone": "Europe/Brussels", "organizer": {"name": "Javier Sanz", "member_id": 109072592}, "id": 17479832, "name": "Online Marketers"}, {"category": {"shortname": "career-business", "id": 2, "name": "career/business"}, "city": "Brussels", "rating": 0, "description": "<p>This group is designed for small business owners and entrepreneurs helping each other to succeed in their business.

Het leren in voeling komen met de supramentale werkelijkheid is voor velen een levensveranderende ervaring. Het reactiveert ons eigen celgeheugen en herinnert ons aan onze eigen volmaaktheid, gezond zijn en heel zijn. Het herstelt het evenwicht in onszelf en activeert ons zelfgenezend vermogen. De meditatie en heling werkt door op alle niveaus, zowel lichamelijk, geestelijk, emotioneel als spiritueel. Zo ontstaat, voor wie zich op dit meditatieve pad engageert, doorheen de tijd meer vertrouwen (kracht), herstel van fysieke balans, vergroting van je intu\u00eftie, verruiming van je grenzen, loslaten van eigen angsten, helderheid in gevoelszaken, een diepe ervaring van rust en vrede. Het leren de leegte en de stilte ervaren brengt je automatisch bij de supramentale werkelijkheid.

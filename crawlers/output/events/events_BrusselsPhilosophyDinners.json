I want to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them.\u201d</i><br/>- Oscar Wilde</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>What is your relationship to your emotions? Are you a slave or a master when it comes to managing your emotions? What are the connections between emotional mastery, freedom, wisdom and happiness?<br/>There has been so much great work done on empowering oneself through the mastery of emotions that I thought this would be an ideal topic for our group. This event will be an opportunity for us to explore wisdom and insights from some of the great philosophers of the past and present, as well as a forum for us to share our insights, theories, thoughts, and experiences.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>No formal philosophy experience or specialized knowledge is required to participate in any of our events (either as a facilitator or as a regular guest). All that is required is that you are open-minded and respectful of your fellow guests. :)</p> <p><br/>\u00a0</p> <p><b>Venue Selection<br/></b></p> <p>Thanks to Cristina for suggesting Le Wine Bar du Sablon for this event.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g188644-d1635467-Reviews-Le_Wine_Bar_du_Sablon-Brussels.html\">Click here for venue details</a><a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.ca/Restaurant_Review-g188644-d1635467-Reviews-Le_Wine_Bar_du_Sablon-Brussels.html\">&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p><br/>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><b>Food for Thought</b></p> <p><b>Facilitator Information</b></p> <p>As previously mentioned, our members take turns helping to facilitate our discussions.

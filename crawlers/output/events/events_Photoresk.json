Of course, because of the big success every year, I advise you to come a bit earlier.<br/>From Hunnegem, the parade goes throughout the streets of the centre of the city, up to the highest top of the 'Oudenberg'.There, near the chapel of the Oudenberg, the parade ends with the throwing of the 'Krakelingen'.<br/>At 20:00 h \u00a0the \"Tonnekensbrand\" is burned on top of the Oudenberg while folk dance sets the atmosphere.<br/>It is possible to travel by train from Brussels to Geraardsbergen. On Sunday, your trip to Geraardsbergen will go via Denderleeuw, where you will have to change to another train. You can find the exact hours in the station of Brussels.\"<br/>So it looks like public transport may be an option, the following looks like a suitable schedule, allowing us enough time in the afternoon to try get good positions and enough time in the evening \u00a0to watch the \"Tonnekensbrand\" and get back to the train station.<br/>Out:12:27 dep13:27 arr<br/>In:21:34 dep22:33 arr<br/>Of course driving is also a possibility, though since it's a festival atmosphere and quite a long day, people may want to have a drink, in which case public transport would make sense.\u00a0</p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Initial message:</b></p> <p>Hi all, I mentioned to Claus about an event I saw recently and he proposed I suggest it to the group. I saw photos of it online a while back and thought it looked interesting, it's called Krakelingen &amp; Tonnekensbrand and is held on Sunday February 23rd in the city of Grammont/Geraardsbergen, about 1 hour drive west of Brussels.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.geraardsbergen.be/content/content/record.php?ID=2195\"><a href=\"http://www.geraardsbergen.be/content/content/record.php?ID=2195\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.geraardsbergen.be/content/content/record.php?ID=2195</a></a></p> <p>There could be potential for some good shooting opportunities, lots of costumes, day &amp; night activities, fire and druids!

Put the manual in your bag.<br/>Advanced, who want to experiment may check how to change between first and second curtain flash trigger....</p> <p>If you have a tripod, bring it. If you don't have one, just don't go and buy a cheap one - choosing the right tripod will affect all your future work with it and there are some important things to consider. We will deal with those technical aspects at another meetup if there is some interest.<br/>If you don't have a tripod, try to bring something on which you can put the camera in a stable way and keep motions away from it. This can be the famous granny's cherry stone cushion or a freezer bag half filled with salt or grain - you just have to find a suitable wall or other support underneath :-)</p> <p><b>Location</b><br/>The location will allow for both, city-views and later the combination of fading ambient light from traffic e.g. on Rue Royale towards Palais de Justice.</p> <p><b>Safety</b><br/>When taking pictures in traffic, always remember that Brussels drivers are now very famous for careful driving - stay safe :-)</p> <p><i>Suggestions and inputs are -as usual- welcome - share your experience, we are all curious ;-)</i><br/>------end update ----------------</p> <p>Hopefully we have clear sky ....</p> <p>Capturing light of the blue hour will require a longer exposure time than normal daytime photos.If you have a tripos - bring it.

At the same time, we will visit one of the exhibitions of the 9th Biennial of Photography of Li\u00e8ge.</p> <p>Calatrava\u2019s station is the magnificent (and costly) work of architect Santiago Calatrava.<br/>This building is a pleasure for the eyes, but it\u2019s a trick for your camera! Bring your zoom or the widest-angle lens you have. This beast is not so easy to capture! I\u2019m very curious what we will get.</p> <p>The second imposed theme is the street \u201cMontagne de Bueren\u201d. The street is actually a 374-steps stairs. How you will put this into your frame is the name of the game ;-) Here, I would rather suggest a tele-lens. See Google Images for inspiration.</p> <p>Between both shooting sessions, we will have a look at a photo-exhibition: \u201cIdole\u201d in the Cit\u00e9 Miroir. It looks like a very interesting exhibition about the power of images (More info on: <a href=\"http://bip-liege.org/en/exhibitions/cite-miroir/\" class=\"linkified\">http://bip-liege.org/en/exhibitions/cite-miroir/</a> ).\u00a0</p> <p>Tentative timing:<br/>- 9:45: Meeting at Brussels Central station, at the locket.

We stay there +/- one hour to take pictures.\u00a0</p> <p>- 12:00: Walk or bus to the city centre. Visit of the photo exhibition \u201cIdole\u201d in the Cit\u00e9 Miroir.<br/>- 13:00: Lunch. I\u2019ll try to book an affordable and popular restaurant. Off course everyone is free to grab some sandwich and stroll in the city.<br/>- 14:00: Walk and shoot around the Montagne de Bueren, the second spot. Discovery of the this hilly and very old neighborhood.\u00a0</p> <p>- 15:30: Let\u2019s drink a Jupiler and talk about our experience. Those in a hurry can catch the 16:00 train.

The technical name is the <b><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis\">perigee</a>-<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygy_%28astronomy%29\">syzygy</a> of the Earth-Moon-Sun system</b>. The term \"supermoon\" is not <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy\">astronomical</a>, but originated in modern <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology\">astrology</a>.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermoon#cite_note-Discover-1\">[1]</a> The association of the Moon with both oceanic and crustal tides has led to claims that the supermoon phenomenon may be associated with increased risk of events such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, but the evidence of such a link is widely held to be unconvincing.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermoon#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></p> <p>The most recent occurrence was on August 10, 2014. The next and closest supermoon of 2014 will be on September 9.<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermoon#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></p> <p>The supermoon at 9. September will align with the axis Cinquantenaire - Montgomery at around 21:46 at an elevation of 13,9\u00b0<br/>A nice opportunity to picture the full moon which seems to be 13% larger as usual. Bring your tripod or borrow one\u00a0 (use the discussion).\u00a0</p> <p>We will have some photographic related discussions and a snack / drink before or after.

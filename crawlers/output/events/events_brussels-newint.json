You will meet him on Saturday if you don't know him yet.</p> <p>Doug noticed, me too that during the last parties we had at my place there was so many nice people and we didn't have the chance to talk to all of the nice people that we really wanted to learn to know.</p> <p>So this time we are going to give ourselves the chance to speak to 5 different people of our choice for 5-10 minutes each without being interupted buy other members.</p> <p>So you will arrive, you look around and choose who you want to learn to know and when the \"speed meet-up\" starts you will have the chance to talk to the person of your choice for 5-10 long minutes.<br/>I guess there will be a bell when your 5-10 minutes is over so you can move on to the next person of your choice.</p> <p>Let's all find out how much fun it can be.</p> <p>- To bring with you like always \"fun spirit\", drinks, lots of drinks if you like to drink a lot and some snacks, chips and cheese of your choice.</p> <p>I will be providing breads and salades. If you want to bring some food, it is always very welcome.</p> <p>See you all on Saturday 25th of April at 8 pm at my place.</p> <p>After our \"speed meet-up\" we can always continue the night dancing or going to the Havana Club and also dancing. :)</p> <p>We are looking forward to our \"Speed Meet-up\" event,</p> <p>Till then enjoy the sunny day,</p> <p>Bakoly<br/>[masked]</p>", "created": 1237498902000, "venue": {"city": "1040 Brussels", "name": "At Bakoly's", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.386671, "address_1": "Sint-Pieterssteenweg 131", "country": "be", "lat": 50.83595, "id": 787330}, "updated": 1243100314000, "visibility": "public", "how_to_find_us": "I will be waiting for you at my place!", "yes_rsvp_count": 59, "time": 1240682400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 66, "maybe_rsvp_count": 7, "id": "9991304", "name": "The brussels New in Town Meetup Group goes to \"speed meet-up\""}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 11, "average": 4.820000171661377}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/brussels-newint/events/10136593/", "group": {"who": "New Residents", "name": "The Brussels New and not New in Town Meetup Group", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1178183561000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "brussels-newint", "id": 491916}, "description": "<p>Hi fun loving people,</p> <p>Since our last \"speed meet-up\" event was a big success and I didn't come up with a better idea we will do the same event again.

Don't miss this chance to see this comedy superstar.</p> <p>Dave Thompson (UK) has performed comedy for over 20 years and TV programmes such as \u2018Harry Hill\u2019s TV Burp\u2019, and \u2018The Sketch Show\u2019 have commissioned Dave as a writer. Dave is best known as the person inside the Tinky Winky costume in \u2018Teletubbies\u2019, which is still shown all over the world.</p> <p>Jeroen Pater (HOLL) is one of the foremost names in Dutch comedy and a godfather of the Utrecht comedy scene. Observational and twisted humour at its finest - he is a bit of a communications skills expert and we're looking forward to the magic he can work on the audience tonight.</p> <p>Joe Eagan (CANADA) currently resides near Copenhagen and runs the English comedy club there. He regularly tours throughout Benelux and Germany and talks about life in Europe, culture clashes, and lots of other fun things - a maple syrup mix of observational humour you don't want to miss.

She has performed at the Free Fringe in Edinburgh, in Manchester, at the International Women\u2019s Festival in Greece and many clubs and venues across Europe. \"Great Energy.

Louis likes to make fun of cultural differences, and have a poke at everyone.</b><b><br/></b> <b><br/>Stewart Johnson (USA) - has a knack for picking out the obvious yet hidden quirks in society and turning them into laughs you will never forget.

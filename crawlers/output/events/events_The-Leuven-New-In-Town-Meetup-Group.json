He is a comedy superstar and has performed all over the world. He hosts his own one-man show at the Edinburgh Fringe festival. He is known as one of the foremost foreign comedians on the UK comedy circuit and headlines clubs across Europe regularly.</p> <p>Soula Notos (GRE) - Born and raised in Holland in a Greek family. Crisis indeed! She knows it by heart. Growing up with shouting and gesturing relatives (small bodies, lots of movement), the only relief was comedy. And now, close to her well deserved pension, she loves to tell stories filled with self-mockery to as many people as possible. She has performed at the Free Fringe in Edinburgh, in Manchester, at the International Women\u2019s Festival in Greece and many clubs and venues across Europe. \"Great Energy. Completely original.\" - Funny's Funny Comedian of the Year 2011 Highly Commended Act.</p> <p>Louis Zezeran (AUS) - runs clubs in Finland and organized the very first Stand Up Comedy shows in Estonia, using the cleverly named title \u201cComedy Estonia\u201d. Louis has a like-able connection with the audience when he performs. He often talks to the audience, making jokes with the crowd and letting them become part of the action. Louis likes to make fun of cultural differences, and have a poke at everyone.</p> <p>Stewart Johnson (USA) - has a knack for picking out the obvious yet hidden quirks in society and turning them into laughs you will never forget. He is an American who is based in Estonia, and has a more mainstream, non-offensive style, frequently drawing upon his experiences as a father. A witty, observational style that will tickle every single one of your funny bones.</p> <p><br/>Hosted by Joe Eagan(CAN)</p> <p>Tickets online here : www.ticketlib.com/standupmay (save about 4\u20ac in presale, it will be 25\u20ac at the door)</p> <p>When: Tues, May 21.

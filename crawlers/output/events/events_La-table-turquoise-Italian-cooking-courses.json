Famous for its wine and white truffles, the Piedmont region\u00a0provides many culinary delights. This region is famous for 'bagna cauda',a garlic and anchovy dip for raw vegetables. Grissini, the slim breadsticks that are found on many Italian tables, have theirorigins in Piedmont. Handmade grissini are very crispy and thin, and can be up to one meter long. The forests produce greatwild mushrooms, which along with cardoons, are gathered and used in many dishes. The 'slow food' movement, the OldWorld's answer to the fast food revolution, was founded in Piedmont in 1986.Tajarin is the egg-yolk-rich pasta from the Piedmont region of Italy. Their golden color comes from the farmhouse egg yolks, which are almost orange in color, and their delicacy comes from being cut into strands from 1/8 to 1/4-inch wide. One of the original recipes called for using 30 egg yolks to a little over 2 pounds of flour!</p> <p>We'll prepare this special pasta with 4 sauces:<br/>1) with meat - Salsiccia e bietole<br/>2) with vegetables - Carbonara di verdure<br/>3) with cheese - Cacio e pepe alla Romana<br/>4) with truffle oil - La Tartufata</p>", "created": 1403958260000, "rsvp_limit": 13, "updated": 1406412972000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 7, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/La-table-turquoise-Italian-cooking-courses/events/191792102/", "time": 1406388600000, "duration": 22500000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "191792102", "name": "Tajarin pasta, the Piedmontese!"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "fee": {"description": "per person", "required": "0", "accepts": "cash", "label": "Price", "currency": "EUR", "amount": 25}, "group": {"who": "Food lovers", "name": "Italian cooking courses \"La table Turquoise\"!", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "approval", "created": 1352716562000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "La-table-turquoise-Italian-cooking-courses", "id": 5807022}, "description": "<p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/3/e/2/600_389593282.jpeg\" /></p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/e/1/4/600_389595892.jpeg\" /></p> <p>\n\n\nToday medical experts largely agree that there is a condition related to gluten other than celiac.

A strong local tradition has it that this dish was born in Castelfranco Emilia (province of Modena).[3] One night during a trip, Lucrezia Borgia checked into an inn in the small town and during the night the host became so captivated by Lucrezia's beauty that he could not resist the urge to peek into her room through the keyhole. The bedroom was lit by only a few candles, and so he could barely see her navel. This pure and innocent vision was enough to send him into an ecstasy that inspired him to create the tortellini that night.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/6/8/0/600_419334912.jpeg\" /></p>", "created": 1412952201000, "rsvp_limit": 10, "venue": {"city": "Etterbeek", "name": "La Table Turquoise, chez Gaia", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.399929, "address_1": "Rue des Tongres ", "country": "be", "lat": 50.83984, "id": 10280052}, "updated": 1413706426000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 8, "time": 1413646200000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 8, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "212624652", "name": "Let's meet up and cook  Italian Tortellini, home made!"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "fee": {"description": "per person", "required": "0", "accepts": "cash", "label": "Price", "currency": "EUR", "amount": 1200}, "group": {"who": "Food lovers", "name": "Italian cooking courses \"La table Turquoise\"!", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "approval", "created": 1352716562000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "La-table-turquoise-Italian-cooking-courses", "id": 5807022}, "description": "<p><b>What is it?</b></p> <p><br/>A full 5 nights /6 days to dream, shop and taste the best food and wines ever in Rome</p> <p><b>Who is it for?</b><br/>For Gourmets, Travelers, Foodies, Fashionists and anyone willing to discover, be surprised, enjoy and learn!</p> <p><b>When?</b></p> <p><br/>October 2014 Departures: second or third Sundays of the Month, which means Sunday the 12th or Sunday the 19th of October</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/c/8/6/600_400467782.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>Rome: One such treasure the entire world is envying, this is for you a unique opportunity of traveling with a local that is in love with her city, loves Food, Wine, Shopping, Art and Antiques\u2026</b>An inspirational tour to discover hidden corners and places, taste and enjoy unthinkable moments.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/7/7/a/600_223214202.jpeg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/f/4/2/600_400468482.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>Departures will be confirmed if the minimum number of participants is reached: 7 people</b></p> <p><br/><b>Program Schedule</b></p> <p><i>Sunday</i></p> <p><i><br/></i> Afternoon<br/>- Meeting of all participants @ Fiumicino Airport 5PM \u2013Transfer with private van and chauffeur to the Hotel \u2013 Check in, time to discover the room and relax.<br/>- 7.30: Meeting at the Hotel to reach Chez Cristina, our co-host and food specialist<br/>- Discover \u201cThe Escape\u201d: meet the hosts,Cristina and Gaia, and discover the amazing detailed program of the week while enjoying the delicious Roman Welcome Buffet.\u00a0</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/0/a/a/600_400468842.jpeg\" /></p> <p>\n\n\n<i>Monday</i></p> <p>Morning</p> <p>- Discover Borgo Pio and the Vatican, Rione Pigna: Piazza Navona and Pantheon Morning break: Visit to the St. Eustachio Cafe: Eustache Coffee is an ancient wood-burning roasting coffee place, born in the thirties, located in Rome, in front of the Senate of the Italian Republic, a step away from Piazza Navona and the Pantheon.

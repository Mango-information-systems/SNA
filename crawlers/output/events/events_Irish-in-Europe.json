IEAI in particular remembers the 50,000 Irish who died during the liberation of Belgium in the first and second world wars. \u0093Let those who come after us see to it that their names be not forgotten\u0094 Hence it will have its first Irish in Europe Remembrance Saturday in Brussels on this Saturday 12 November at 12 noon. The IEAI will lay a wreath at the Anglo-Belgian War Memorial at Place Poelaert / Poelaertplein in front of Palais de Justice de Bruxelles and across from the Infantry Memorial of Brussels in memory of the Belgian foot soldiers who fought in World War I and II. (Metro or Tram Louise 3 minutes walk). The Anglo-Belgian War Memorial commemorates the heroic Belgian people who helped the British prisoners of war during World War I. Designed by the British sculptor Charles Sargeant Jagger [masked]), the monument was inaugurated in 1923. The composition, in Brainvilliers stone, features figures of British and Belgian soldiers. The sides are covered with reliefs representing scenes of Belgian common folk tending to wounded British soldiers. There is also a relief of an Irish harp. A plaster cast of the statues of soldiers can be seen at the Military Museum in Brussels. Following the laying of the wreath, a poem by Irish Poet Francis Ledwidge will be recited. He enlisted in the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers in 1914 and was killed in the battle of Ypres on the 31st July 1917. See www.francisledwidge.com . After the ceremony, guests shall proceed to Mac Sweeney's Irish Pub for warm refreshments at Jean Stasstraat, Brussels 1060 located to the right of Avenue Louise about 7 minutes walk from the memorial. On the way the group shall stop at the site of the former residence in exile of William Smith O\u0092Brien, one of the leaders of the Irish Rebellion of 1848. He also lived in Hungary where he advised the Hungarian Independence Movement. It is for this reason that the IEAI will organise the William Smith O&amp;acute; Brien Irish-Hungarian Annual Memorial Lecture. Every one is welcome to come along to the first Remembrance Saturday ceremony.

We'll embark <b>IC 1535</b>, leaving Brussels Central Station (Bruxelles Central/Brussel Centraal) at <b>14:21</b>. Meet outside the door of Starbucks cafe\u00a0 at 14.00 in the ticket area of the station and allow 10 minutes to buy your ticket. A bit more than one hour later you'll see the Our Lady Church, Saint-Saviours Cathedral and the Belfry tower come in sight. We should arrive\u00a0 in Bruges at <b>15:35</b> although they plan works between Brussel-South and Denderleeuw and Aalter and Landegem during that weekend. So expect a 15 minutes delay between Brussels and Ghent and another (!) 15 minutes between Ghent and Bruges. But no worries ... even if we arrive at 4pm, there is still\u00a0 lots of beer left to taste and the craic, we make it ourselves!</p> <p>Once outside the station, a horse tram is waiting (free of charge) to get, via picturesque streets, to the Markt. Where the Belfry Tower has been turned into one big beer bottle. For the 5th time in history the BAB organize their beer festival.</p> <p>After being admired the beautiful scenery on the half an hour cobblestone dominated tour we arrive at the center piece of the day.</p> <p>Practically we enter via the gate to the right. The entry itself is free. You can buy a glass for \u20ac 3 (not necessary, but pretty vital to enjoy your drink). Besides that, you have to buy tokens (\u20ac 1,25) if you want to consume something. Basicly one token enables you to taste one beer (0,15l). You can buy combos (1 glass + 10 tokens) to get you started.<br/>To have more information about what you're drinking or giving remarks to yourself, you can start giving out those tokens on the catalogue (it is available in English).<br/>Once we got through this hall, we'll pass the Cuisine Culinaire workshop. At this location 4 top chefs of Bruges will prepare some fine dish based on Belgian beer and you can have a bite of it when it finished. All across the festival you'll find TVs, mostly used for promotional purposes but when things are cooking, it's broadcast live on it, so you can keep enjoying your beer.<br/>But we haven't come to the beers yet \u2026 therefore we have to go out the building. Go up the steps (the first 15 of the 366 in total)\u00a0 and you'll arrive in a new world. Brewers heaven! There are 65 brewers present. You simply go with your token and your glass to his booth. He/She will clean it and fill it up with the liquid of your choice. In total you can taste more than 250 different beers. If that doesn't quench your thirst! No need to leave the kids home because they also serve fine water, lemonade and coke. But unfortunately no whiskeys, although you can buy bottles of real Belgian whiskey made with beer (what else?)...</p> <p>There is food on the premises, such as cheese and sandwiches. And if you don't mind walking out of the festival, there are tons of good bars, restaurants nearby.</p> <p>When the night has fallen and you long for your bed (caused by fatigue or the high ABV) you can assure you that 2 trains an hour bring you back to the capital of Belgium (and Europe so you will...)</p> <p>There are regular trains back to Brussels (until 10pm)</p> <p>20:35 - 21:39 (direction Genk)<br/>20:58 - 22:01 (direction Welkenraedt)<br/>21:35 - 22:39 (direction Genk)<br/>21:58 - 23:01 (direction Welkenraedt)<br/><b>22:35 - 23:39 (direction Brussel Zuid)</b> !<br/><b>23:05 - 00:09\u00a0 (direction Welkenraedt)</b></p> <p>If you think you can't make that, there is a hotel just next to the railway station.</p> <p>(ETAP HOTEL Brugge Centrum Station - from \u20ac49/night)</p> <p>04:50 - 06:01 (direction Eupen)</p>", "created": 1326056589000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "Entrance to Starbucks cafe at Gare Central in ticket area", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.357113, "address_1": "Gare Central Brussels", "country": "be", "lat": 50.845467, "id": 5506002}, "updated": 1328365453000, "visibility": "public", "how_to_find_us": "Meet up  the railway station of Brussels Central  to leave  at 14.21", "yes_rsvp_count": 4, "time": 1328360400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "47227962", "name": "Irish in Europe Visit to Bruges BAB Beer Festival"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 3600000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Irish-in-Europe/events/51674532/", "group": {"who": "Community Builders", "name": "Irish in Europe", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1315316543000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Irish-in-Europe", "id": 2442332}, "description": "<p><a href=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/1/e/4/event_72453252.jpegCork\" class=\"linkified\">http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/1/e/4/event_72453252.jpegCork</a> Jazz Festival Club of Brussels continues its winter season with a live jazz and rag time afternoon session with D\u00e9nes Doszt\u00e1n *Also a session of Irish Melodies. www.denesdosztan.com @ The Meeting Point Date: Sunday February 12 and 19, 2012 from 12.h.00 till 15.h.00.

Each year, our Saint Patrick\u2019s Day Parade Committee organises a Parade to mark our National Day of Celebration. To date, we have successfully organised three Parades. This year, we plan to continue this tradition with a fourth one.</p> <p>Can you help us achieve this? With very little effort, you could! A small donation is all that it takes. Our organisation is run entirely on a voluntary basis and currently receives no external financial support or funding. Most of the Parade costs in previous years were paid for by contributions from members and volunteers, and by small donations received. But we can\u2019t expect the same people to pay the costs every year.</p> <p>We need \u201ca little help from our friends\u201d. That\u2019s where you can play your part to make it work. We cannot engage any marching band or cultural group and organise Parade-related activities unless we have sufficient funds in our bank account or reliable pledges of financial support by the next few weeks. Even if you can only make a small contribution, it\u2019s enough to make a difference. It will ensure that the Parade can be successful, enjoyable and good fun.</p> <p><b>The Parade is at 13h30 on Sunday, 11th of March. It starts at the statue of \u2018Le Chien Vert\u2019 in the corner of Park Cinquantenaire.</b> Participation is free and it makes a lovely afternoon family outing.</p> <p>Donations can be made in two ways: (i) by Bank transfer to:: IEAI Bank Account No:[masked] IBAN: BE[masked] SWIFT/BIC-code: SPAABE22</p> <p>(ii) by Credit card via Pay Pal.

Ons Saint Patrick's Day Parade Comit\u00e9 organiseert elk jaar een parade ter gelegenheid van onze nationale feestdag. Tot op heden hebben we met succes drie optochten georganiseerd. Dit jaar zijn we van plan om deze traditie verder te zetten met een vierde optocht. We hebben dan ook uw steun nodig om dit te realiseren. Een kleine donatie zal alvast veel helpen. Onze organisatie wordt immers op volledig vrijwillige basis gedragen en ontvangt momenteel dan ook geen externe financi\u00eble steun of financiering. De jongste jaren werden de meeste kosten van de optocht betaald door bijdragen van leden en vrijwilligers en via kleine donaties. Maar we kunnen niet verwachten dat dezelfde mensen jaar in jaar uit deze kosten dragen. We hebben \"een beetje hulp van onze vrienden\" nodig. U kan hierin een rol spelen. We kunnen geen muziekensemble of culturele groep uitnodigen en andere met de optocht gerelateerde activiteiten organiseren, zonder voldoende geld op de bank of zonder betrouwbare beloften van financi\u00eble steun in de komende weken. Zelfs een kleine bijdrage is genoeg om een verschil te maken. De optocht kan zo een succesvol, plezierig en leuk evenement worden. De Parade gaat door op zondag 11 maart om 13.30u. en begint bij het standbeeld 'Le Chien Vert' op de hoek van het Jubelpark. Deelname is gratis en het is een perfecte uitstap voor de hele familie. Donaties kunnen op twee manieren : (i) Via overschrijving: IEAI bankrekeningnummer:[masked] IBAN: BE[masked] SWIFT/BIC-code: SPAABE22 (ii) Door creditcard via Pay Pal. Donaties via deze site worden verwerkt met behulp van een beveiligde server.

Apr\u00e8s trois ann\u00e9es de travail d\u00e9vou\u00e9, cette association a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue par l\u2019Etat Belge et confirm\u00e9e par ordonnance Royale, en avril 2011. Ce Comit\u00e9 a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 organiser un d\u00e9fil\u00e9 chaque ann\u00e9e pour c\u00e9l\u00e9brer notre jour National Irlandais. Nous voudrions continuer cette tradition cette ann\u00e9e avec notre 4\u00e8me d\u00e9fil\u00e9. Pourriez-vous nous aider avec ce projet ? Avec peu d\u2019effort, vous pourriez ! Une petite donation est tout ce qu\u2019il faudrait. Notre Comit\u00e9 de Parade St. Patrick fonctionne uniquement gr\u00e2ce au travail des volontaires \u2013 principalement irlandais. Il ne re\u00e7oit aucun soutien financier externe ou subvention. Les frais des d\u00e9fil\u00e9s ces trois derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 couverts par les contributions des membres et les donations des volontaires. Nous ne pourrions pas demander aux m\u00eames personnes de payer les frais chaque ann\u00e9e. Cette ann\u00e9e, nous avons besoin d\u2019un petit peu d\u2019aide de nos amis et de ceux qui aiment participer \u00e0 notre D\u00e9fil\u00e9 irlandais. Nous ne pourrions pas engager les Bandes de Musique Traditionnelle Irlandaise, ou les groupes de Danse Irlandaise traditionnelle, qui font partie int\u00e9grale du D\u00e9fil\u00e9, si nous n\u2019avons pas les fonds n\u00e9cessaires pour couvrir les frais. Nous devons confirmer ces engagements pour d\u00e9but mars. Votre contribution, m\u00eame si elle est petite, ferait une grande diff\u00e9rence. Elle aiderait \u00e0 assurer un D\u00e9fil\u00e9 r\u00e9ussi, beau \u00e0 voir et agr\u00e9able pour ceux qui participent et qui viennent le regarder. Notre Parade de Saint Patrick aura lieu \u00e0 13h30 dimanche le 11 mars. Cela commencera pr\u00e8s de la statue du \u00ab Chien Vert \u00bb, situ\u00e9 au coin du Parc Cinquantenaire. Participation est gratuite et c\u2019est un \u00e9v\u00e8nement familial et agr\u00e9able. Voici les coordonn\u00e9es pour les deux fa\u00e7ons par lesquelles on peut faire une donation: (i) Virement bancaire \u00e0 : Compte No. [masked] - de notre association IEAI IBAN : BE[masked] BIC/SWIFT code : SPAABE22 (ii) Carte Bancaire via Pay Pal.

You can tackle anyone above shoulder height.<br/>The team<br/>the team consists of 8 forwards and 7 backs.<br/>the forwards are aranged with the two biggest on either side of another reasonably big person. these are called props (either side) and a hooker in the middle (its not what you think)<br/>Then there are two taller than average and well built people behind them these are called the second row.<br/>Then the back row consists of two flankers and one number 8.<br/>the backs are 1 scrum half, 1 fly half, 1 inside centre, 1 outside centre, 2 wings, and 1 full back.<br/>The game it's self is mainly people from either side trying to score trys (5 points) drop goals and penelties (3 points) and conversions (taken after a try is scored 2 points).<br/>This is done by the team with the ball running at the the team without the ball with a number of rucks (where each team compets for the ball on the floor) and mauls (each team trys to get the ball of the other when its off the ground).</p>", "created": 1337174218000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels 1000", "name": "Hairy Canary", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.383712, "address_1": "12, Rue Archimede,", "country": "be", "lat": 50.844433, "id": 7227692}, "updated": 1337453149000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 1, "time": 1337441400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "65017982", "name": "European Heineken Cup-Rugby\u2013All Ireland Final \u2013 Leinster V Ulster Party"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Irish-in-Europe/events/60413312/", "group": {"who": "Community Builders", "name": "Irish in Europe", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1315316543000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Irish-in-Europe", "id": 2442332}, "description": "<p>This Social -Network Meeting will review Irish in Europe and\u00a0 intercultual programme and integration\u00a0 events in the coming Months .

Each walk gives the visitor a complete experience of the atmosphere of that area during this period by pointing out the people and revolutionary events associated with it.

Her professional life has been equally varied, ranging from teacher to translator and writer.<br/>A life-long love of history coupled with living in the ancient heart of Paris led her to write this book.</p> <p>It took all the daring of an English author to write a guide that<br/>transports the walker back in time to the Paris of the French Revolution. From the dwindling splendour of a Versailles cut off from the realities of late 18th-century France, Jan Kelley leads us with passion and enthusiasm, animated by numerous contemporary eye-witness accounts, on a comprehensive and detailed journey through a Paris full of darkness and of hope. Her book illuminates this difficult and complex period -one that opened the door to a shining age of liberty.</p> <p>- Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lacaille,<br/>Curator, Mus\u00e9e National des Chateaux de Versailles et Trianon</p> <p>RSVP<br/>To register, please send an email with \"Path of the Patriots\" in the subject field and stating clearly your NAME to: <a href=\"http://uk.mc1710.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=janni_kelley%40yahoo.com\">janni_kelley@ yahoo.com</a> or<br/>phone[masked]</p> <p>CONTACT<br/><a href=\"http://uk.mc1710.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=janni_kelley%40yahoo.com\">janni_kelley@ yahoo.com</a></p>", "created": 1336650603000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "Book Launch Venue", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.389586, "address_1": "295 Avenue dAuderghem,1040", "country": "be", "lat": 50.831627, "id": 7450722}, "updated": 1338496088000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 1, "time": 1338483600000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "64214892", "name": "Book Launch- Path of the Patriots"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Irish-in-Europe/events/64365472/", "group": {"who": "Community Builders", "name": "Irish in Europe", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1315316543000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Irish-in-Europe", "id": 2442332}, "description": "<p>At Kitty O' Sheas Irish Pub - Metro Schuman</p> <p>The Votes of the Irish Electorate will be counted on June 1.Will the Irish give\u00a0 approval to the Fiscal Treaty?

Sometimes known as the \"poet of the blackbirds\", The Poetry of Ledwidge is an integral part of the Treasury of Irish Verse.</p> <p>On 31 July 1917, a group from Ledwidge's battalion of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers were road-laying in preparation for an assault during the Third Battle of Ypres, near the village of Boezinge, northwest of Ieper (Ypres). While Ledwidge was drinking tea in a mud hole with his comrades, a shell exploded alongside, killing the poet and five others. A chaplain who knew him, Father Devas, arrived soon after, and recorded \"Ledwidge killed, blown to bits.\"</p> <p>The poems Ledwidge wrote on active service revealed his pride at being a soldier, as he believed, in the service of Ireland. He wondered whether he would find a soldier's death. The dead were buried at Carrefour de Rose, and later re-interred in the nearby Artillery Wood Military Cemetery, Boezinge, (where the Welsh poet Hedd Wyn, killed on the same day, is also buried). A stone tablet commemorates him in the Island of Ireland Peace Park, Messines, Belgium. His work as \u201cpeasant poet\u201d and \u201csoldier poet\u201d, once a standard part of the Irish school curriculum, faded from view for many decades of the 20th century. Its intensity, coupled with a revived interest in his period, has restored it to life.</p> <p>The reading of his poem \"Ireland\" forms part of the wreath laying ceremony for annual Irish in Europe Remembrance Saturday Commemoration. For the first ceremony\u00a0in 2011, the poem was recited by Mary Jo Mullarkey.</p> <p>Every one is welcome along to this poetry table to learn more about the poet.Admission Free.</p> <p>Please visit www.francisledwidge.com and be sure to visit while in Ireland the Francis Ledwidge Museum at Janesville,Slane,County Meath.</p>", "created": 1342377985000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "  The Meeting Point", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.379311, "address_1": "Rue de Taciturne 39", "country": "be", "lat": 50.845318, "id": 4203122}, "updated": 1343807999000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 6, "time": 1343750400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "73447162", "name": "Francis Ledwidge Poetry Table on the Terrace"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Irish-in-Europe/events/75501452/", "group": {"who": "Community Builders", "name": "Irish in Europe", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1315316543000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Irish-in-Europe", "id": 2442332}, "description": "<p>All Irish in Europe Members and Friends are invited to the Fifth Annual European Theme Special Claddagh Toastmasters Meeting</p> <p>To celebrate and create awareness for the 2012 European Year for Active Ageing and Solidarity between Generations</p> <p>Thursday August 2th.\u00a0 Welcome coffee at 18.45, Meeting 19.00 to 21.00</p> <p>Admission Free.</p> <p><br/>The objective this year is to inform ourselves of the need to bring new solutions to the pending challenges of an ageing society in Europe, to promote active citizenship and stimulate awareness on how people can continue to contribute to the economy and society in Brussels and to look after themselves as they grow old.

For example, the Toastmaster of the evening performs performing his/her role in both Irish and English, and we\u00a0try to alternate speeches and table topics being between both languages, whenever possible but for the coming months we may have English only sessions until the membership of our Irish speakers increases.</p> <p>Guests are welcome, and will be asked for a short introduction at the start of the meeting and for their feedback at the end of the meeting. <b><i>Come and experience it for yourself!</p> <p></i></b></p> <p>The ultimate objective of the meeting is to emphasise how planning can play an important role in active aging and how Toastmasters is an ideal organisation to serve all generations to help you plan and enjoy an active life.</p> <p>Click <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/claddaghtoastmasters/home/next-meetings\">Next Meetings</a> to find a date that suits you, and email<a href=\"mailto:[masked]\">[masked]</a>, to confirm your place.

Annual Irish in Europe Remembrance Saturday.</p> <p>The Irish in Europe Association (International) AISBL in compliance with its aims and objectives remembers all Irish and the Irish Diaspora in all armies who died in all wars and conflicts. IEAI in particular remembers the 50,000 Irish who died and estimated 500,000 members of the Irish Diaspora in all Armies who participated during the liberation of Belgium in the first and second world wars.</p> <p>\u0093Let those who come after us see to it that their names be not forgotten\u0094<br/>Hence it will have its second Irish in Europe Remembrance Saturday in Brussels on Saturday 10 November at 11 am. The IEAI will lay a wreath at the Anglo-Belgian War Memorial at Place Poelaert / Poelaertplein in front of Palais de Justice de Bruxelles and across from the Infantry Memorial of Brussels in memory of the Belgian foot soldiers who fought in World War I and II. (Metro or Tram Louise 3 minutes walk). The Anglo-Belgian War Memorial commemorates the heroic Belgian people who helped the Irish and British prisoners of war during World War I. Designed by the British sculptor Charles Sargeant Jagger [masked]), the monument was inaugurated in 1923. The composition, in Brainvilliers stone, features figures of Irish, British and Belgian soldiers. The sides are covered with reliefs representing scenes of Belgian common folk tending to wounded British soldiers. There is also a relief of an Irish harp. A plaster cast of the statues of soldiers can be seen at the Military Museum in Brussels. Following the laying of the wreath, a poem by Irish Poet Francis Ledwidge will be recited. He enlisted in the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers in 1914 and was killed in the battle of Ypres on the 31st July 1917. See www.francisledwidge.com . After the ceremony, guests shall proceed to Mac Sweeney's Irish Pub for warm refreshments at Jean Stasstraat, Brussels 1060 located to the right of Avenue Louise about 7 minutes walk from the memorial. On the way the group shall stop at the site of the former residence in exile of William Smith O Brien, one of the leaders of the Irish Rebellion of 1848 and direct descendent of King Brian Boru who was killed at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. He also lived in Hungary where he advised the Hungarian Independence Movement.

To date, the use of Irish and English is fairly balanced for some sessions during an evening .

Doctors are said to have denied her requests because the foetus's heartbeat was present - reportedly telling her: \"This is a Catholic country.\" She was not able to get a medical termination because the <b>Irish State</b> failed to respect a <b>decision</b> of the <b>Irish Supreme Court in 1992</b> to put in place guide lines that could have saved her life.See Editorial from <b>Irish Examiner</b> on her death.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/editorial/savita-halappanavar--failure-to-lead-has-cost-us-dearly-214117.html#.UKaJSezCt04.twitter\"><a href=\"http://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/editorial/savita-halappanavar--failure-to-lead-has-cost-us-dearly-214117.html#.UKaJSezCt04.twitter\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/editorial/savita-halappanavar--failure-to-lead-has-cost-us-dearly-214117.html#.UKaJSezCt04.twitter</a></a></p> <p><b>The Irish Bishops of the Roman Catholic Church</b> issued a statement and said \u201dWhere a seriously ill pregnant woman needs medical treatment which may put the life of her baby at risk, such treatments are ethically permissible provided every effort has been made to save the life of both the mother and her baby\u201d <b>see full statement.</b><a href=\"http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/bishops-express-sympathy-for-halapanavar-but-support-current-legal-and-medical-measures-574820.html#.UKq9o6VtktA.twitter\"><a href=\"http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/bishops-express-sympathy-for-halapanavar-but-support-current-legal-and-medical-measures-574820.html#.UKq9o6VtktA.twitter\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/bishops-express-sympathy-for-halapanavar-but-support-current-legal-and-medical-measures-574820.html#.UKq9o6VtktA.twitter</a></a></p> <p><b>The Irish Times</b> has created a day by day analysis of the response from around the world to the tragic loss of her life. <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/topics/death-of-savita/\"><a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/topics/death-of-savita/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.irishtimes.com/topics/death-of-savita/</a></a></p> <p><b>The husband of Savita Halaqpannavar</b>, <b>Mr Praveen Halappanavar</b> through his solicitor has already written to the <b>Irish\u00a0 Minister for Health James Reilly seeking a full public sworn inquiry</b> into the death.

However, in practice, this is not really possible unless we have a high number of Irish speakers at all meetings , so we are very pleased to welcome English-only speakers. To date, the use of Irish and English is fairly balanced for some sessions during an evening . For example, the Toastmaster of the evening performs performing his/her role in both Irish and English, and we try to alternate speeches and table topics being between both languages, whenever possible but for the coming months we may have English only sessions until the membership of our Irish speakers increases.</p> <p>Guests are welcome, and will be asked for a short introduction at the start of the meeting and for their feedback at the end of the meeting. Come and experience it for yourself!</p> <p>The ultimate objective of the meeting is to emphasise how communication and\u00a0 planning can play an important role in the home and work place\u00a0 and how Toastmasters is an ideal organisation to serve all generations to help you plan and enjoy an active life.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Last thing (finally !!!): the first part of the meeting will be held as usual with lots of Table Topics and impromptu speeches and second part consists of prepared speeches given by members in accordence with set objectives followed by evaluations to imrove .There is no obligation for guests to speak unless they agree to do so.</p> <p>email [masked], to confirm your place.

Admission Free!.</p> <p>We are a bilingual Irish-English club with a membership from about ten different nationalities, which requires that most members have a good oral command of Irish and or English. However, in practice, this is not really possible unless we have a high number of Irish speakers at all meetings , so we are very pleased to welcome English-only speakers. To date, the use of Irish and English is fairly balanced for some sessions during an evening . For example, the Toastmaster of the evening performs performing his/her role in both Irish and English, and we try to alternate speeches and table topics being between both languages, whenever possible but for the coming months we may have English only sessions until the membership of our Irish speakers increases.</p> <p>Guests are welcome, and will be asked for a short introduction at the start of the meeting and for their feedback at the end of the meeting. Come and experience it for yourself!</p> <p>The ultimate objective of the meeting is to emphasise how communication and planning can play an important role in the home and work place and how Toastmasters is an ideal organisation to serve all generations to help you plan and enjoy an active life.</p> <p>Last thing (finally !!!): the first part of the meeting will be held as usual with lots of Table Topics and impromptu speeches and second part consists of prepared speeches given by members in accordence with set objectives followed by evaluations to imrove .There is no obligation for guests to speak unless they agree to do so.</p> <p>email [masked], to confirm your place.

The photographs were taken over a 2 year period and the project is truly a labour of love by Luc Teper showing the richness and the so often\u2019 taken for granted value\u2019 of trees in our local environments.

The \u201cLike a Tree\u201d exhibition is a photo exhibition capturing the beauty &amp; nature of Brussels Capital Region numerous trees &amp; accompanying wildlife.<br/>Not always recognised for its beauty as a city due to its predominant political status Brussels is a well kept secret for a weekend break away. This exhibition helps towards exposing Brussels for its natural beauty &amp; cultural vibrancy.<br/>The exhibition fittingly opens on Europe day (May 9th) &amp; runs until 23rd June.<br/>The Gallery Kinsale is curating the exhibition on the back of a very successful exhibition in Brussels at Halles Saint Gery in association the Irish in Europe Association (International)aisbl and with its many partners &amp; contributors from Cork and around Ireland.<br/>It is hoped to maximise this unique event to promote Belgium as a holiday destination and particularly support the recently introduced direct flights from Cork\u2019s International Airport to Brussels.<br/>Indeed the many Trees that are part of Brussels to be seen in this exhibition relate closely to the landscape of Cork City &amp; that isn\u2019t where the similarities end between the two regions. Did you know the word Brussels comes from the word for Marsh like Cork &amp; it also was built on a monastic site like Cork was &amp; today both cities share many similarities from their non-uniform house structures to many underground rivers &amp; canals from their marsh beginnings.<br/>Brussels is really considered as a green city where trees are considered as a key esthetical part of their urban landscape enhancing the quality of life for its inhabitants just as it is in Cork<br/>Luc Teper has taken his photographs of the Brussels\u2019s trees over a two year period catching their beauty from the early morning till the late evening &amp; it is an exercise well worthwhile when you see the exhibition he has brought before us.<br/>Speaking of the exhibition Ken Buckley of The Gallery Kinsale said<br/>\u201cThis is the first time we have curated a photography exhibition &amp; I couldn\u2019t imagine starting at a higher level, the standard of excellence in these photos is second to none &amp; I would encourage all photographers, nature lovers and anyone with an interest in beauty to visit the exhibition &amp; enjoy Lucs work\u201d<br/>Luc is teacher at Paul Hankar Institute in Brussels who have travelled with Luc to Cork for the opening on May 9th. Photography is his passion and his favourite themes are nature but also of the cities that have a deep cultural tradition such as Bruges, Venice and Brussels where he was born and where he is still living and working today. I am sure after Lucs visit to Cork we may well be visiting an exhibition of Corks natural beauty in Brussels in the future &amp; I can see the title already\u2026.\u201dLike a Tree\u201d..

First performed on 14 February 1895 at St. James's Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious person\u00e6 in order to escape burdensome social obligations. Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways. Contemporary reviews all praised the play's humour, though some were cautious about its explicit lack of social messages, while others foresaw the modern consensus that it was the culmination of Wilde's artistic career so far. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde's most enduringly popular play.<br/>The successful opening night marked the climax of Wilde's career but also heralded his downfall. The Marquess of Queensberry, father of Lord Alfred Douglas, an intimate friend of Wilde, planned to present Wilde a bouquet of rotten vegetables and disrupt the show. Wilde was tipped off and Queensberry was refused admission. Soon afterwards, however, their feud came to a climax in court, where Wilde's homosexual double life was revealed to the Victorian public and he was eventually sentenced to imprisonment. Wilde's notoriety caused the play, despite its success, to be closed after just 86 performances. After his release, he published the play from exile in Paris, but he wrote no further comic or dramatic work.</p> <p>The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde<br/>Directed by Andrew McIlroy</p> <p>The Irish Theatre Group is very proud to present The Importance of Being Earnest at Palais Des Beaux-Arts Studio.<br/>Andrew McIIroy's exciting new take on Oscar Wilde's classic sparkles, while never losing sight of the dark satire behind the facade of glittering comedy.<br/>Wit, intrigue and passion are to the fore in this tale of true love and finding ones way through the pretences and artifices of social existence.<br/>Visually and emotionally powerful, the ITG's Importance of Being Earnest has brought the finest talent together to create a theatrical event worthy of the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union.<br/>As Wilde said of the philosophy of The Importance of Being Earnest, \"...we should treat all the trivial things of life seriously and all the serious things of life with a sincere and studied triviality.\" The ITG's Importance of Being Earnest promises to be an trivially serious evenings theatre.</p> <p>This production is supported by the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union.<br/>Centre for Fine Arts / Studio<br/>Tuesday 21 &gt; Saturday[masked]<br/>More date and hour info<br/>Tuesday[masked] - 20:00<br/>Wednesday[masked] - 20:00<br/>Thursday[masked] - 20:00<br/>Friday[masked] - 20:00<br/>Saturday[masked] - 20:00</p> <p>Price at the ticketingoffice<br/>\u20ac 18,00: standard rate</p> <p>Over half the tickets already sold for The Importance of Being Earnest<br/>Last few remaining tickets with Friday and Saturday almost completely sold out.</p> <p>\"I' ve now realised for the first time in my life the vital Importance of Being Earnest.\"</p> <p>Just under a week to go and, thanks to the incredible demand for tickets to our next show, They only have a few tickets left for Friday and Saturday night with the other three nights not far behind.</p> <p><br/>If you have been delaying getting your ticket then this is the time to get back into Lady Bracknell' s good books.<br/>Tickets can be purchased directly from the BOZAR website, by telephone (02/[masked]) or in person.<br/>It takes a long time and a lot of hard dedicated work from a lot of people to put on a show like this.<br/>They have once again pulled together a dedicated multinational cast and crew who have been working tirelessly for many months.<br/>We have laughed together, we have cried, we have argued and then we have laughed a lot more.</p> <p><br/>Our moment in the spotlight is almost upon us and all too soon it will be over.<br/>We are putting the finishing touches to the Andrew McIIroy' s exciting new take on Oscar Wilde's classic and are so much looking forward to sharing with you the results of all our hard work.<br/>It will be fun, noisy, energetic and alternative, Wilde would hopefully have approved.<br/>Lady Bracknell: I am glad, however, that he made up his mind at the last to some definite course of action.<br/>We look forward to seeing you there!</p> <p>The Importance of Being Earnest, at Palais des Beaux-Arts Studio, running from Tuesday 21st to Saturday 25th May.<br/>This production is supported by the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union.</p>", "created": 1368876050000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": " Palais des Beaux-Arts (the Bozar)", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.359539, "address_1": "Rue Ravenstein 23 1000 Bruxelles", "country": "be", "lat": 50.844238, "id": 7792682}, "updated": 1369505001000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 6, "time": 1369159200000, "duration": 345600000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "120003462", "name": "Oscar Wilde- The Importance of Being Earnest now showing in Brussels"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Irish-in-Europe/events/120463092/", "group": {"who": "Community Builders", "name": "Irish in Europe", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1315316543000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Irish-in-Europe", "id": 2442332}, "description": "<p>Subject: Brussels 20km - Sunday, 26 May - Sponsorship</p> <p><a href=\"http://runkeeper.com/race/20km-brussels-2886/39772\"><a href=\"http://runkeeper.com/race/20km-brussels-2886/39772\" class=\"linkified\">http://runkeeper.com/race/20km-brussels-2886/39772</a></a></p> <p>You are invited to support Sarah Donohoe an active member of the\u00a0 Irish in Europe Association who is running with the Irish Presidency Team.</p> <p>A Personal Appeal From Sarah ......</p> <p><br/>I am running in the Brussels 20km next Sunday, 26 May.

The Photographic Exhibition is by Luc Teper of the Paul Hankar Institute of Brussels.

The contrasts, natural beauty and use of light are stunning and will certainly leave you with a lasting impression of the need and desire to plant a tree in your garden or in your local park or indeed protect it!!</p> <p><br/>The \u201c Like a Tree\u2019 Exhibition was exhibited in parallel with the recent 50 Day Irish in Europe Art &amp; Photo Exhibition \u2013 \u201cCork Meets Brussels \u2013 Brussels Meets Westport\u201d at <b>Halles Saint Gery Cultural Centre</b> in the heart of Brussels. \u201cBringing Brussels and Ireland closer together in Europe\u201d<br/>The photo element of the Halles Saint Gery Exhibition is now being exhibited as the Irish in Europe-Galerie Anspach Photo Exhibition to celebrate the final weeks of the Irish Presidency in Brussels. It includes a Paul Hankar media exhibition of the Irish in Europe Cultural Exchange program and the recent visit of Westport town council to Brussels. It is now confirmed that this exhibition will be extended to the end of July to celebrate the 40 anniversary of Ireland\u2019s membership of the European Union. Over half a million visitors will view the Photo Exhibition at Galerie Anspach.<br/>The \u2018Like a Tree \u2018exhibition opens Saturday June 29th and runs until 26th July which is curated by \u201cThe Gallery Kinsale\u201d on the back of the very successful exhibition in Brussels at Halles Saint Gery.<br/>Indeed the many Trees that are part of Brussels to be seen in this exhibition relate closely to the landscape of Westport &amp; that isn\u2019t where the similarities end between the two regions.<br/>Brussels is really considered as a green city where trees are considered as a key esthetical part of their urban landscape enhancing the quality of life for its inhabitants just as it is in Westport.</p> <p>The word <b>Mhaigh Eo</b> means <b>\"the plain of the Yew Tree\"</b> &amp; Westport has enjoyed a strong tree heritage over the centuries that continues to this day.<br/>Luc Teper has taken his photographs of the Brussels\u2019s trees over a two year period catching their beauty from the early morning till the late evening &amp; it is an exercise well worthwhile when you see the exhibition he has brought before us.<br/>Speaking of the exhibition Ken Buckley of The Gallery Kinsale said<br/>\u201cThis is the first time we have curated a photography exhibition &amp; I couldn\u2019t imagine starting at a higher level, the standard of excellence in these photos is second to none &amp; I would encourage all photographers, nature lovers and anyone with an interest in beauty to visit the exhibition &amp; enjoy Lucs work\u201d<br/>Luc is a teacher at Paul Hankar Institute in Brussels who have travelled with Luc to Westport for the opening on Saturday June 29th. The Exhibition will be Officially opened at 11.00am at Westport Library by Cllr Michael McLaughlin, Cathaoirleach of Westport Town Council.<br/>Photography is his passion and his favourite themes are nature but also of the cities that have a deep cultural tradition such as Bruges, Venice and Brussels where he was born and where he is still living and working today. I am sure after Luc\u2019s visit to Westport and his love of natural beauty we may well be visiting an exhibition of Westport in Brussels in the future.<br/>END</p> <p><b>About The Irish in Europe Association -</b><br/>The Irish in Europe Association (International)aisbl( IEAI) (founded in 2011) objectives include the promotion of Irish culture as a means of integration and also the promotion of Cultural Exchange programmes between Belgium and Ireland.<br/>The opening of this exhibition serves as the continuation of the cultural exchange program in Ireland to celebrate the friendship that exists between Ireland and Belgium.<br/>Useful Links \u2013<br/><a href=\"http://www.westporttc.ie/home/index.aspx\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.westporttc.ie/home/index.aspx</a><br/>www.thegallerykinsale.com\u00a0<br/><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Irish-in-Europe/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/Irish-in-Europe/</a><br/><a href=\"http://www.europost.bg/article?id=7980\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.europost.bg/article?id=7980</a></p>", "created": 1372618335000, "venue": {"city": "County Mayo", "name": " Westport Library ", "repinned": false, "lon": -9.315866, "address_1": "The  Crescent  Westport", "country": "ie", "lat": 53.846313, "id": 14297732}, "updated": 1373731273000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 2, "time": 1372665600000, "duration": 1065600000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "127256962", "name": "Brussels 'Like a Tree' Exhibition at Westport-Ireland"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Irish-in-Europe/events/128460372/", "group": {"who": "Community Builders", "name": "Irish in Europe", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1315316543000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Irish-in-Europe", "id": 2442332}, "description": "<p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/5/8/c/event_137450572.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Dear Music colleagues,<br/>This reminder to confirm the session at <b>\"LA PORTE NOIRE\"</b>Tuesday, 9 July kicking off around 21.00 - 21.30<br/>\"LA PORTE NOIRE\"Rue des Alexiens, 67, Cellebroederstraat.1000 - Bruxelles/Brussel<br/>It's just off the Boulevard de L'Empereur / Keiserslaan (at traffic lights)At the top of the street, in front of a small square..Close to the Central Railway/Metro Station and the bowling.<br/>Hope to see you there.Best regards.Slan,Patrick</p> <p>Also onTuesday, 13 August<br/>\"LA PORTE NOIRE\"Rue des Alexiens, 67, Cellebroederstraat.1000 - Bruxelles/Brussel<br/>It's just off the Boulevard de L'Empereur / Keiserslaan (at traffic lights)At the top of the street, in front of a small square.Close to the Central Railway/Metro Station and the bowling.<br/>Hope to see you there.Best regards.Slan,Patrick</p> <p><b>Invitation to Trad-Irish Music Session at \"LA PORTE NOIRE\"</b></p> <p><br/>Tuesday Febraury 12<br/><b>\"LA PORTE NOIRE\"</b></p> <p>Irish in Europe Meetup Members and friends are invited to go along to the Monthly Trad Irish Music Session at \"LA PORTE NOIRE\" with group <b>organised by Patrick Van Uffelen</b>.<br/>Admission is free!!!<br/>All trad irish musicians or those learning are invited to participate with Patrick's group and every one who does not play is welcome to listen in and enjoy the craic.

The photographs were taken over a 2 year period and the project is truly a labo<a href=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/c/4/a/event_56167242.jpegur\" class=\"linkified\">http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/c/4/a/event_56167242.jpegur</a> of love by Luc Teper showing the richness and the so often\u2019 taken for granted value\u2019 of trees in our local environments. The contrasts, natural beauty and use of light are stunning and will certainly leave you with a lasting impression of the need and desire to plant a tree in your garden or in your local park or indeed protect it!!</p> <p><br/>The \u201c Like a Tree\u2019 Exhibition was exhibited in parallel with the recent 50 Day Irish in Europe Art &amp; Photo Exhibition \u2013 \u201cCork Meets Brussels \u2013 Brussels Meets Westport\u201d at <b>Halles Saint Gery Cultural Centre</b> in the heart of Brussels. \u201cBringing Brussels and Ireland closer together in Europe\u201d<br/>The photo element of the Halles Saint Gery Exhibition is now being exhibited as the Irish in Europe-Galerie Anspach Photo Exhibition to celebrate the final weeks of the Irish Presidency in Brussels. It includes a Paul Hankar media exhibition of the Irish in Europe Cultural Exchange program and the recent visit of Westport town council to Brussels. It is now confirmed that this exhibition will be extended to the end of July to celebrate the 40 anniversary of Ireland\u2019s membership of the European Union. Over half a million visitors will view the Photo Exhibition at Galerie Anspach.<br/>The \u2018Like a Tree \u2018exhibition opens Saturday June 29th and runs until 26th July which is curated by \u201cThe Gallery Kinsale\u201d on the back of the very successful exhibition in Brussels at Halles Saint Gery.<br/>Indeed the many Trees that are part of Brussels to be seen in this exhibition relate closely to the landscape of Westport &amp; that isn\u2019t where the similarities end between the two regions.<br/>Brussels is really considered as a green city where trees are considered as a key esthetical part of their urban landscape enhancing the quality of life for its inhabitants just as it is in Westport.</p> <p>The word <b>Mhaigh Eo</b> means <b>\"the plain of the Yew Tree\"</b> &amp; Westport has enjoyed a strong tree heritage over the centuries that continues to this day.<br/>Luc Teper has taken his photographs of the Brussels\u2019s trees over a two year period catching their beauty from the early morning till the late evening &amp; it is an exercise well worthwhile when you see the exhibition he has brought before us.<br/>Speaking of the exhibition Ken Buckley of The Gallery Kinsale said<br/>\u201cThis is the first time we have curated a photography exhibition &amp; I couldn\u2019t imagine starting at a higher level, the standard of excellence in these photos is second to none &amp; I would encourage all photographers, nature lovers and anyone with an interest in beauty to visit the exhibition &amp; enjoy Lucs work\u201d<br/>Luc is a teacher at Paul Hankar Institute in Brussels who have travelled with Luc to Westport for the opening on Saturday June 29th. The Exhibition was Officially opened at 11.00am at Westport Library by Cllr Michael McLaughlin, Cathaoirleach of Westport Town Council.<br/>Photography is Luc's passion and his favourite themes are nature but also of the cities that have a deep cultural tradition such as Bruges, Venice and Brussels where he was born and where he is still living and working today. I am sure after Luc\u2019s visit to Westport and his love of natural beauty we may well be visiting an exhibition of Westport in Brussels in the future.<br/>END</p> <p><b>About The Irish in Europe Association -</b><br/>The Irish in Europe Association (International)aisbl( IEAI) (founded in 2011) objectives include the promotion of Irish culture as a means of integration and also the promotion of Cultural Exchange programmes between Belgium and Ireland.<br/>The opening of this exhibition serves as the continuation of the cultural exchange program in Ireland to celebrate the friendship that exists between Ireland and Belgium.<br/>Useful Links \u2013<br/><a href=\"http://www.westporttc.ie/home/index.aspx\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.westporttc.ie/home/index.aspx</a><br/>www.thegallerykinsale.com\u00a0<br/><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Irish-in-Europe/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/Irish-in-Europe/</a><br/><a href=\"http://www.europost.bg/article?id=7980\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.europost.bg/article?id=7980</a></p>", "created": 1374228929000, "venue": {"city": "County Mayo", "name": " Westport Library ", "repinned": false, "lon": -9.315866, "address_1": "The  Crescent  Westport", "country": "ie", "lat": 53.846313, "id": 14297732}, "updated": 1374894778000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 1, "time": 1374235200000, "duration": 658800000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "130341962", "name": "Brussels 'Like a Tree' Exhibition at Westport-Ireland"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Irish-in-Europe/events/131991132/", "group": {"who": "Community Builders", "name": "Irish in Europe", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1315316543000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Irish-in-Europe", "id": 2442332}, "description": "<p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/c/4/a/event_56167242.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>The Irish in Europe Association (International) aisbl</b></p> <p>Celebrates the 40 Anniversary of Ireland\u2019s Membership of the European Union<br/>with the<br/>Irish in Europe-Galerie Anspach Photo Exhibition</p> <p><br/><b>Cork meets Brussels - Brussels meets Westport</b></p> <p><b>\u2018\u2018Bringing Brussels and Ireland closer in Europe\u2019\u2019</b><br/><b>An outstanding exposition of Ireland, its scenery, culture and history is presented at Galerie Anspach , a lively social space in the cultural and historic heart of Brussels with photos depicting the social, cultural and sporting features of the regions, visitors can also see a rich archive gallery.</b><br/>14 June to 5 August 2013</p> <p><br/><b>Open Monday to Saturday 10.00 to 19.00</b><br/><b>Late opening on Fridays to 19.30</b><br/>Admission Free</p> <p><b>This Anspach Exhibition is one of the initiatives of the \"Irish in Europe cultural program\u201d in association with THE GALLERY-KINSALE which aims to promote cultural exchanges between Brussels and Ireland.</b></p> <p><br/>[masked]\u00a0 www.meetup.com/Irish-in-Europe</p> <p><br/><b>Galerie Anspach on Boulevard Anspach in Brussels 1000 is designed as a modern-day architectural gem and a tribute to the prestigious \u00ab Belle Epoque \u00bb of Brussels entailing the conservation of historic facades providing that unique shopping experience.

Influenced by taste and culture, each European city developed variant Art Nouveau style, some more floral some more geometric. This exhibition aims to demonstrate the Art Nouveau style diversity in Europe through decorative and architectural details.<br/>For this project the students were inspired by how iron, a rough and functional material, took an aesthetic dimension during the Art Nouveau movement. Actualising to a modern material, they used cardboard giving it a new aesthetic and functional definition.

This exhibition aims to demonstrate the Art Nouveau style diversity in Europe through decorative and architectural details.<br/>For this project the students were inspired by how iron, a rough and functional material, took an aesthetic dimension during the Art Nouveau movement.

Annual Irish in Europe Remembrance Saturday.</p> <p>The Irish in Europe Association (International) AISBL in compliance with its aims and objectives remembers all Irish and the Irish Diaspora in all armies who died in all wars and conflicts. IEAI in particular remembers the 50,000 Irish who died and estimated 500,000 members of the Irish Diaspora in all Armies who participated during the liberation of Belgium in the first and second world wars.</p> <p>\u0093Let those who come after us see to it that their names be not forgotten\u0094<br/>Hence it will have its third Irish in Europe Remembrance Saturday in Brussels on Saturday 9 November at 11.30 am. The IEAI will lay a wreath at the Anglo-Belgian War Memorial at Place Poelaert / Poelaertplein in front of Palais de Justice de Bruxelles and across from the Infantry Memorial of Brussels in memory of the Belgian foot soldiers who fought in World War I and II. (Metro or Tram Louise 3 minutes walk). The Anglo-Belgian War Memorial commemorates the heroic Belgian people who helped the Irish and British prisoners of war during World War I. Designed by the British sculptor Charles Sargeant Jagger [masked]), the monument was inaugurated in 1923. The composition, in Brainvilliers stone, features figures of Irish, British and Belgian soldiers. The sides are covered with reliefs representing scenes of Belgian common folk tending to wounded British soldiers. There is also a relief of an Irish harp. A plaster cast of the statues of soldiers can be seen at the Military Museum in Brussels. Following the laying of the wreath, a poem by Irish Poet Francis Ledwidge will be recited. He enlisted in the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers in 1914 and was killed in the battle of Ypres on the 31st July 1917. See <a href=\"http://www.francisledwidge.com\">www.francisledwidge.com</a> . After the ceremony, guests shall proceed to Mac Sweeney's Irish Pub for warm refreshments at Jean Stasstraat, Brussels 1060 located to the right of Avenue Louise about 7 minutes walk from the memorial. On the way the group shall stop at the site of the former residence in exile of William Smith O Brien, one of the leaders of the Irish Rebellion of 1848 and direct descendent of King Brian Boru who was killed at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. He also lived in Hungary where he advised the Hungarian Independence Movement.

Like!\u201d</p> <p>Art Nouveau Conceptual Exhibition<br/>This exhibition is the work of Paul Hankar Institute\u2019s Interior Design Students which offers an overview of Art Nouveau style in Europe from late 19th till early 20th century.

At the recent Irish-Belgian Weekend in January at the Paul Hankar Institute in Brussels, exhibits on display from Clonakilty Artists included Art Nouveau-Celtic fusion exhibits.</p> <p>The opportunity for both exhibitions to display in tandem at the Cork Vision Centre has added a dynamic visual experience to these exhibitions allowing the viewer to almost experience first-hand a walk through the beautiful city of Brussels. more info at <a href=\"http://www.corkvisioncentre.com/corkvision2/Main/LikeATreeArt.htm\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.corkvisioncentre.com/corkvision2/Main/LikeATreeArt.htm</a></p>", "created": 1392934356000, "venue": {"city": "Cork", "name": "Cork Vision Centre @ St. Peter's, ", "repinned": false, "lon": -8.478447, "address_1": "North Main Street", "country": "ie", "lat": 51.899757, "id": 18112472}, "updated": 1392998835000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 1, "time": 1392973200000, "duration": 25200000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "167375662", "name": "Cultural Exchange Exhibition Last Day  at Cork Vision Centre"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 3600000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Irish-in-Europe/events/167375142/", "group": {"who": "Community Builders", "name": "Irish in Europe", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1315316543000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Irish-in-Europe", "id": 2442332}, "description": "<p>This will be a network event and a planning meeting for the Brussels Saint Patrick's Day Parade......Every one welcome to come along .....</p>", "created": 1392934116000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "The Old Oak Irish Pub and Restaurant ", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.384869, "address_1": "Rue Franklin 26", "country": "be", "lat": 50.844727, "id": 6563312}, "updated": 1393069651000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 1, "time": 1393066800000, "duration": 1800000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "167375142", "name": "Irish in Europe Network Meeting"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 3600000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Irish-in-Europe/events/168716642/", "group": {"who": "Community Builders", "name": "Irish in Europe", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1315316543000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Irish-in-Europe", "id": 2442332}, "description": "<p>This will be a network event and a planning meeting for the Brussels Saint Patrick's Day Parade and associated events ......Every one welcome to come along .....We would also like to hear from anyone who may be interested in volunteering\u00a0 to man the tourist and cultural information stand\u00a0 for the second annual Irish in Europe Photo Exhibition at Halles Saint Gery from April 3.</p> <p><br/>We will meet in section of Old Oak closest to the window facing onto the street.</p> <p><br/>contact [masked]\u00a0 and or [masked]</p>", "created": 1393585615000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "The Old Oak Irish Pub and Restaurant ", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.384869, "address_1": "Rue Franklin 26", "country": "be", "lat": 50.844727, "id": 6563312}, "updated": 1393893112000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 2, "time": 1393864200000, "duration": 3600000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "168716642", "name": "Patrick\u2019s Day Parade Volunteers Meeting"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 3600000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Irish-in-Europe/events/168895372/", "group": {"who": "Community Builders", "name": "Irish in Europe", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1315316543000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Irish-in-Europe", "id": 2442332}, "description": "<p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/2/8/c/600_155861612.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>Claddagh Toastmasters of Brussels\u00a0</b> will host their seventh annual \u2018Seachtain na Gaeilge\u2019 lecture in English given by\u00a0<b>Dr Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riain</b> on the history and nature of the Irish language with theme <b>\"Why Irish? - An Ghaeilge: Canathaobh?\"</b></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/f/2/600_79322802.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Claddagh TOASTMASTERS Bilingual CLUB OF BRUSSELS M\u00c1ISTR\u00cd SL\u00c1INT\u00cd an Chladaigh \u2013 Club D\u00e1theangach na Bruis\u00e9ile</p> <p>Claddagh Toastmasters will host their seventh annual \u2018Seachtain na Gaeilge\u2019 lecture in English on the history and nature of the Irish language with theme \"Why Irish? - An Ghaeilge: Canathaobh?\" on Thursday March 6, 2014 at the Quaker House, Square Ambiorix 50, 1000 Brussels(Metro Schuman) \"Why Irish? - An Ghaeilge: Canathaobh?\"</p> <p><br/>\u201cWhy Irish? With over 10,000 marching on the streets of Dublin on 15 February 2014, and the resignation of the Languages Commissioner last week, the Irish language remains controversial. Some wonder what it is all about. Why does Irish ignite passions, both positive and negative? How does it relate to the culture of modern Ireland? And why do so many Irish people remain emotionally attached to a language most of them do not speak in everyday life? Is Irish of no practical value, as some claim\u2026.or could there be another side to the story?\u201d</p> <p><br/><b>Come along and find out more on the Irish Language!</b></p> <p>It will be preceded by a short demonstration bilingual table topics session.

This year, we plan to continue this tradition with a sixth one.</p> <p>Can you help us achieve this? With very little effort, you could! A small donation is all that it takes.</p> <p>Our Parade is run entirely on a voluntary basis and currently receives no external financial support or funding. Most of the Parade costs in previous years were paid for by contributions from members and volunteers, and by small donations received. But we can\u2019t expect the same people to pay the costs every year. We need \u201ca little help from our friends\u201d.<br/>That\u2019s where you can play your part to make it work. We do expect to expand the Parade format next year as austerity measures phase out in Ireland and Belgium in anticipation that new sources of funding will emerge from private sponsors and cultural bodies. In the mean time, we depend on donations to cover the administrative costs to have an Official Parade. The cost, regardless of the size of the Parade, comes to close to two thousand euro. The engagement of any marching bands or cultural groups and the organisation of Parade-related activities are dependent entirely on having sufficient funds in our bank account or reliable pledges of financial support. Even if you can only make a small contribution, it\u2019s enough to make a difference. It will ensure that the Parade can be successful, enjoyable and good fun.<br/>In order to preserve the historical records of past parades, a new website is being constructed to provide ease of access to all the archives. Many volunteers &amp; supporters of past parades have left Brussels and sadly in some cases, have died. We now recognise the urgent need to have a better permanent record of their contributions. Should you have any photos, written accounts or radio and tv-links from the past parades or of the 2014 parade please contact us:<br/>Many are aware that the Parade Committee served as the impetus that gave rise to the establishment of the Irish in Europe Association (International) aisbl (IEAI).The main function of the IEAI is to help the world wide Irish Diaspora living and working in Europe and promote Irish culture, community building and micro integration in local communities through a network of Chapters in Europe. Membership is open to all nationalities.</p> <p>The IEAI made a major cultural contribution in 2013 for the year of the Irish Presidency with concerts and exhibitions at Halles Saint Gery &amp; Gallery Anspach with the support of mainly back to back sponsorship. Volunteers manned the exhibitions and helped with the distribution of cultural and tourist information in seven languages promoting the island of Ireland. IEAI also launched the Irish in Europe Cultural Exchange program between Ireland and Belgium. Exhibitions showcasing Brussels are now on tour in Ireland to help build cultural relations. The promotion of the Cork\u2013Brussels direct flights is ongoing and in April, we are back in Halles Saint Gery with the Irish in Europe Photo Exhibition to help promote \u2018Limerick City of Culture\u2019 and \u2018Sligo European Town of Sport\u2019 with other mini exhibitions to include Irish commemoration photos of the First World War. As we grow our relations between Ireland and Belgium, the significance of the Saint Patrick\u2019s Day Parade in the EU Capital and the need to support it becomes more apparent. Most funding sources in Ireland and Belgium require that we have \u201cown funds\u201d to be eligible for funding and this is where you can play your part to make our fundraising successful. The Parade assembles 13h00 on Sunday, 16th of March. It starts at the statue of \u2018Le Chien Vert\u2019 in the corner of Parc Cinquantenaire/Jubelpark. It is a multicultural opportunity to bring individuals, families and community organisations together at one big event, to get to know new Irish people and to make new friends and bridge the cultural divide with other communities. Participation is free and it makes a lovely afternoon family outing.</p> <p>Every one is invited to \u201cWear the Green\u201d, \u201cWalk in the Parade\u201d<br/>&amp;<br/>Be \u201cIrish for the Day\u201d.</p> <p>Donations can be made in two ways:<br/>by Bank transfer to the IEAI Bankaccount by using these details:<br/>Account name IEAI: Bank Crelan \u2013 Agentschap Jubelpark / Parc 50Naire, Avenue d\u00b4 Auderghem 59A,1040 Brussels.<br/>IBAN BE[masked]<br/>BIC SPAABE22</p> <p>by Credit card: via Paypal by using: [masked] or click on this link <a href=\"http://irish-in-europe.eu/site/index.php/support-us/\" class=\"linkified\">http://irish-in-europe.eu/site/index.php/support-us/</a> all persons who make contribution to the parade financial or otherwise are listed on the Roll of Honour Sections of the Parade Web site.<br/><a href=\"http://www.brussels-st-patricks-day-parade.be\">www.brussels-st-patricks-day-parade.be</a> For Parade Events: Visit our Irish in Europe events site - <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Irish-in-Europe\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/Irish-in-Europe</a></p> <p>Thank you for reading this and thanks in advance for whatever contribution you decide to make.<br/>Denis J.

This year, we plan to continue this tradition with a sixth one.</p> <p>Can you help us achieve this? With very little effort, you could! A small donation is all that it takes.</p> <p>Our Parade is run entirely on a voluntary basis and currently receives no external financial support or funding. Most of the Parade costs in previous years were paid for by contributions from members and volunteers, and by small donations received. But we can\u2019t expect the same people to pay the costs every year. We need \u201ca little help from our friends\u201d.<br/>That\u2019s where you can play your part to make it work. We do expect to expand the Parade format next year as austerity measures phase out in Ireland and Belgium in anticipation that new sources of funding will emerge from private sponsors and cultural bodies. In the mean time, we depend on donations to cover the administrative costs to have an Official Parade. The cost, regardless of the size of the Parade, comes to close to two thousand euro. The engagement of any marching bands or cultural groups and the organisation of Parade-related activities are dependent entirely on having sufficient funds in our bank account or reliable pledges of financial support. Even if you can only make a small contribution, it\u2019s enough to make a difference. It will ensure that the Parade can be successful, enjoyable and good fun.<br/>In order to preserve the historical records of past parades, a new website is being constructed to provide ease of access to all the archives. Many volunteers &amp; supporters of past parades have left Brussels and sadly in some cases, have died. We now recognise the urgent need to have a better permanent record of their contributions. Should you have any photos, written accounts or radio and tv-links from the past parades or of the 2014 parade please contact us:<br/>Many are aware that the Parade Committee served as the impetus that gave rise to the establishment of the Irish in Europe Association (International) aisbl (IEAI).The main function of the IEAI is to help the world wide Irish Diaspora living and working in Europe and promote Irish culture, community building and micro integration in local communities through a network of Chapters in Europe. Membership is open to all nationalities.</p> <p>The IEAI made a major cultural contribution in 2013 for the year of the Irish Presidency with concerts and exhibitions at Halles Saint Gery &amp; Gallery Anspach with the support of mainly back to back sponsorship. Volunteers manned the exhibitions and helped with the distribution of cultural and tourist information in seven languages promoting the island of Ireland. IEAI also launched the Irish in Europe Cultural Exchange program between Ireland and Belgium. Exhibitions showcasing Brussels are now on tour in Ireland to help build cultural relations. The promotion of the Cork\u2013Brussels direct flights is ongoing and in April, we are back in Halles Saint Gery with the Irish in Europe Photo Exhibition to help promote \u2018Limerick City of Culture\u2019 and \u2018Sligo European Town of Sport\u2019 with other mini exhibitions to include Irish commemoration photos of the First World War. As we grow our relations between Ireland and Belgium, the significance of the Saint Patrick\u2019s Day Parade in the EU Capital and the need to support it becomes more apparent. Most funding sources in Ireland and Belgium require that we have \u201cown funds\u201d to be eligible for funding and this is where you can play your part to make our fundraising successful. The Parade assembles 13h00 on Sunday, 16th of March. It starts at the statue of \u2018Le Chien Vert\u2019 in the corner of Parc Cinquantenaire/Jubelpark. It is a multicultural opportunity to bring individuals, families and community organisations together at one big event, to get to know new Irish people and to make new friends and bridge the cultural divide with other communities. Participation is free and it makes a lovely afternoon family outing.</p> <p>Every one is invited to \u201cWear the Green\u201d, \u201cWalk in the Parade\u201d<br/>&amp;<br/>Be \u201cIrish for the Day\u201d.</p> <p>Donations can be made in two ways:<br/>by Bank transfer to the IEAI Bankaccount by using these details:<br/>Account name IEAI: Bank Crelan \u2013 Agentschap Jubelpark / Parc 50Naire, Avenue d\u00b4 Auderghem 59A,1040 Brussels.<br/>IBAN BE[masked]<br/>BIC SPAABE22</p> <p>by Credit card: via Paypal by using: [masked] or click on this link <a href=\"http://irish-in-europe.eu/site/index.php/support-us/\" class=\"linkified\">http://irish-in-europe.eu/site/index.php/support-us/</a> all persons who make contribution to the parade financial or otherwise are listed on the Roll of Honour Sections of the Parade Web site.<br/><a href=\"http://www.brussels-st-patricks-day-parade.be\">www.brussels-st-patricks-day-parade.be</a> For Parade Events: Visit our Irish in Europe events site - <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Irish-in-Europe\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/Irish-in-Europe</a></p> <p>Thank you for reading this and thanks in advance for whatever contribution you decide to make.<br/>Denis J.

The exhibition also contributes to generating markets for new direct flights from Belgium, for Shannon and Knock to service the Wild Atlantic Way.</p> <p>The project will strive to highlight the export of Irish Art and Crafts for the mutual focus on cultural and business benefits between the two countries. Information will be continuously at hand with art experts offering guidance for the duration of the show.</p> <p>\u201cWe are excited and proud for the second year to have the opportunity to showcase a selection of high quality Irish art in the cultural centre of Brussels. We will be taking this opportunity to promote Ireland as a holiday destination, through a fantastic selection of photographs and prints that represent counties Limerick and Sligo.\u201d (Catherine McEntee, exhibition curator)</p> <p>This year\u2019s participants include Annmarie Bourke, Conor Doherty, Godfrey Graham, Gavin Hogg and Ciaran McHugh, as well as a selection of images courtesy of F\u00e1ilte Ireland and information from Craft Bay on Irish Craft.\u00a0</p> <p>The Brussels Exhibition is part of the ongoing Irish in Europe cultural exchange programme launched in Ireland and Belgium in 2013 by the Brussels-based Irish in Europe Association. The main function of the IEAI is to help the world-wide Irish Diaspora living and working in Europe and promote Irish culture, community-building and micro integration through a network of Chapters in Europe.

The exhibition also contributes to generating markets for new direct flights from Belgium, for Shannon and Knock to service the Wild Atlantic Way.</p> <p>The project will strive to highlight the export of Irish Art and Crafts for the mutual focus on cultural and business benefits between the two countries. Information will be continuously at hand with art experts offering guidance for the duration of the show.</p> <p>\u201cWe are excited and proud for the second year to have the opportunity to showcase a selection of high quality Irish art in the cultural centre of Brussels.

Sometimes known as the \"poet of the blackbirds\", The Poetry of Ledwidge is an integral part of the Treasury of Irish Verse.</p> <p>Francis Ledwidge was born on August 19 ,1887 at Slane, County Meath, Ireland, into a large and poverty-stricken family.</p> <p>Within a week of the outbreak of WW1, he joined the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers in Dublin.</p> <p>In 1915 he saw action at Suvla Bay in Turkey. Having survived Gallipoli , he was dismayed by the news of the Easter Rising and was court-martialled and demoted for overstaying his home leave and being drunk in uniform.</p> <p>\u00a0On 31 July 1917, a group from Ledwidge's battalion of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers were road-laying near Pilkem Ridge in preparation for an assault during the Third Battle of Ypres, near the village of Boezinge, northwest of Ieper (Ypres). While Ledwidge was drinking tea in a mud hole with his comrades, a shell exploded alongside, killing the poet and five others. A chaplain who knew him, Father Devas, arrived soon after, and recorded \"Ledwidge killed, blown to bits.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In due course he was laid to rest in the Artillery Wood CWGC Cemetery at Boezinge in Belgium.<br/>\u00a0\n<i>\u201cHe shall not hear the bittern cry<br/>In the wild sky, where he is lain,<br/>Nor voices of the sweeter birds<br/>Above the wailing of the rain.</i><br/>\u00a0\nOne of three verses in his \u2018Lament for Thomas MacDonagh\u2019, one the executed leaders of the Irish rebellion at Easter, 1916.</p> <p>When he wrote these lines he unwittingly composed his own enduring epitaph.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ballinagree.freeservers.com/llew.html\">The Wife of Llew</a></p> <p>\n\nA poem for Wales by Francis Ledwidge...</p> <p>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ballinagree.freeservers.com/june.html\">June</a></p> <p>\n\nA poem for summer by Francis Ledwidge...</p> <p><br/><a href=\"http://www.ballinagree.freeservers.com/tree.html\">A Robin on a Broken Tree</a></p> <p><br/>Just four poignant lines of longing for home by Francis Ledwidge</p> <p><br/>The poems Ledwidge wrote on active service revealed his pride at being a soldier, as he believed, in the service of Ireland. He wondered whether he would find a soldier's death. The dead were buried at Carrefour de Rose, and later re-interred in the nearby Artillery Wood Military Cemetery, Boezinge, (where the Welsh poet Hedd Wyn, killed on the same day, is also buried). A stone tablet commemorates him in the Island of Ireland Peace Park, Messines, Belgium. His work as \u201cpeasant poet\u201d and \u201csoldier poet\u201d, once a standard part of the Irish school curriculum, faded from view for many decades of the 20th century. Its intensity, coupled with a revived interest in his period, has restored it to life.</p> <p>The reading of his poem \"Ireland\" forms part of the wreath laying ceremony for annual Irish in Europe Remembrance Saturday Commemoration. For the first ceremony\u00a0in 2011, the poem was recited by Mary Jo Mullarkey.</p> <p><b>Ellis Humphrey Evans (\u2018Hedd Wyn\u2019)</b><br/>\u00a0\nA Welsh poet, killed in action during World War I, on the same day, during the same battle, in the same sector as Francis Ledwidge.<br/>\u00a0\nPrivate of the 15th Royal Welsh Fusiliers.

The IEAI will lay a wreath at the Anglo-Belgian War Memorial at Place Poelaert / Poelaertplein in front of Palais de Justice de Bruxelles and across from the Infantry Memorial of Brussels in memory of the Belgian foot soldiers who fought in World War I and II. (Metro or Tram Louise 3 minutes walk). The Anglo-Belgian War Memorial commemorates the heroic Belgian people who helped the Irish and British prisoners of war during World War I. Designed by the British sculptor Charles Sargeant Jagger [masked]), the monument was inaugurated in 1923. The composition, in Brainvilliers stone, features figures of Irish, British and Belgian soldiers. The sides are covered with reliefs representing scenes of Belgian common folk tending to wounded British soldiers. There is also a relief of an Irish harp. A plaster cast of the statues of soldiers can be seen at the Military Museum in Brussels. Following the laying of the wreath, a poem by Irish Poet Francis Ledwidge will be recited. He enlisted in the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers in 1914 and was killed in the battle of Ypres on the 31st July 1917. See <a href=\"http://www.francisledwidge.com\">www.francisledwidge.com</a> . After the ceremony, guests shall proceed to Mac Sweeney's Irish Pub for warm refreshments at Jean Stasstraat, Brussels 1060 located to the right of Avenue Louise about 7 minutes walk from the memorial.

(Metro or Tram Louise 3 minutes walk- It is embedded in wall on the right of the tramline direction Sablon and after Cercle de Lorraine ).</p> <p><br/>The Anglo-Belgian War Memorial commemorates the heroic Belgian people who helped the Irish and British prisoners of war during World War I. Designed by the British sculptor Charles Sargeant Jagger [masked]), the monument was inaugurated in 1923. The composition, in Brainvilliers stone, features figures of Irish, British and Belgian soldiers. The sides are covered with reliefs representing scenes of Belgian common folk tending to wounded British soldiers. There is also a relief of an Irish harp. A plaster cast of the statues of soldiers can be seen at the Military Museum in Brussels. The monument has just been restored and looks very much refreshed.\u00a0</p> <p><br/>Following the laying of the wreath, a poem by Irish Poet Francis Ledwidge will be recited. He enlisted in the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers in 1914 and was killed in the battle of Ypres on the 31st July 1917. See <a href=\"http://www.francisledwidge.com\">www.francisledwidge.com</a> . After the ceremony, guests shall proceed to Pub-Mini Louise\u00a0 for warm refreshments at Rue Jourdan\u00a0 3(opposite Boss Window Displays) Brussels 1060 located to the right of Avenue Louise about 7 minutes walk from the memorial.

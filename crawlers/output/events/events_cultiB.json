Completely original.\" - Funny's Funny Comedian of the Year 2011 Highly Commended Act.</p> <p><b>Louis</b> <b>Zezeran (AUS)</b> - runs clubs in Finland and organized the very first Stand Up Comedy shows in Estonia, using the cleverly named title \u201cComedy Estonia\u201d. Louis has a like-able connection with the audience when he performs. He often talks to the audience, making jokes with the crowd and letting them become part of the action. Louis likes to make fun of cultural differences, and have a poke at everyone.</p> <p><b>Stewart Johnson (USA)</b> - has a knack for picking out the obvious yet hidden quirks in society and turning them into laughs you will never forget. He is an American who is based in Estonia, and has a more mainstream, non-offensive style, frequently drawing upon his experiences as a father. A witty, observational style that will tickle every single one of your funny bones.</p> <p><b>Hosted by Joe Eagan (CAN)</b></p> <p>Tickets online here : <a href=\"http://www.ticketlib.com/standupmay\">www.ticketlib.com/standupmay</a> (save about 4\u20ac in presale, it will be 25\u20ac at the door)<br/>When: Tues, May 21.

He has spread Swedish comedy all over the world in places like Russia, India, South Africa, Finland, France, Germany, Belgium, UK, Estonia, China, etc. His comedy style mixes observational comedy with an absurdist touch, all in a high energy physical stage persona. In 2013 he toured with his solo show \"It\u00b4s the Flourist\u2019s Fault\".\u00a0</p> <p>Brian Jordan USA<br/>Brian is an American based in Sweden. He has seen the best of the best live at the famous Punchline in Atlanta, but Brian has developed his own style of storytelling comedy. They say that part truth is involved in most comedians\u2019 stories, and Brian is no different. If you figure out which parts of his stories are true, they could shock you. He has been in commercials, lent his voice for audiobooks, and is looking forward to his first movie role, should one come along.</p> <p>Claus Reiss DK<br/>Best Bagpipe Comedy Show in Europe...\u2026and the only one. The Danish comedian Claus Reiss is the only man in Europe who also entertains with the bagpipe. He uses the odd instrument to play well-known tunes, but in a most untraditional way. He spices up his performance with storytelling and jokes in a close interaction with the audience. Claus Reiss has been on the international comedy circuit for several years now attending some of the world\u2019s biggest comedy festivals. His shows have made people laugh across Europe due to his surprising mixture of bagpipe music, comedy and improvisation.</p> <p>Manu Moreau BEL<br/>Is he a bird, is he a plane? Well, if he\u2019s up that high, he must be insane! From a small township to the big city, he\u2019s been there, done that and sold the t-shirt. His first steps in comedy weren\u2019t so long ago, but every step since has been closely monitored for your safety. His comedy works similar to cocaine: one line after the other, very addictive.</p> <p>Soula Notos GRE<br/>Originally from Greece, but now based in Utrecht, she has fantastic energy on stage and a quick-wittedness only to adore and admire. Soula will be our host this evening and we can't wait to welcome her on stage to MC the show.\u00a0</p> <p>Entrance through Place Van Meyel</p> <p>Pasta corner on site too if you are hungry.</p>", "created": 1396702275000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "Bouche-a-Oreille", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.390471, "address_1": "rue Felix Hap 11", "country": "be", "lat": 50.837231, "id": 12546182}, "updated": 1397596175000, "visibility": "public", "how_to_find_us": "The venue is on just 200 meters from Metro Stop Merode.

An event for which a lot of the Friends of Culti Group are invited! This event is lined up in 8 chapters of Culti Group!</p> <p>The program is very simple: we all meet in the bar, together with some expats, long term residents and locals from The Hague Culti Arjan will make a plan - and off we go.</p> <p>The day will end with EARLY DINNER at the BEACH!</p> <p>- <b>Coming from Antwerpen or Brussels</b> -</p> <p>The last train back to Belgium leaves around 20:30 PM - this means that if you come, going back from the beach around 19:30 PM is 100% save.</p> <p>The Train Time from Brussels to The Hague is 150 minutes, the Traintime from Antwerpen is less.</p> <p>Going by car will take around 100 minutes - maybe a bit more - it's sunday.</p> <p>And IF you come by car... Than maybe drop a comment and ask people to come with you :)</p> <p>- <b>The Hall of Mirrors</b> -</p> <p>One atraction already is for certain! The House of Mirrors. Set the inner child free!

And when we have seen some, we'll go find a place to eat something :)</p> <p>The costs are EUR 8,--, this is the fee for the host but you wont have to buy a ticket for the Hall or Mirrors. BTW,\u00a0 please also pay a 10% tip on every shared bill. The host is spending ALL the money that he collects for Meetups only.</p> <p>Once in The Hague, you can buy a DAYTICKET for Public transport - this will be costing you EUR 6,--.

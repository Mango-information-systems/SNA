Then\u00a0the table visitors can provide\u00a0any valuable feedback/questions/tips during an interactive conversation, lead by the host. The host\u00a0will visualise the feedback on the paper Canvas.\u00a0</i></p> <p><i>- After a given amount of time, everybody switches to another table \u2013 except the host.</i></p> <p><i>- The end result of a full cycle is an entrepreneur with an enriched Canvas &amp; the other participants that learned a lot</i></p> <p><i>Depending on the number of \u2018equiped\u2019 enterpreneurs (with a canvas), we will have multiple World Caf\u00e9 cycles. We will make sure at least 1 coach (= Business Modeler with experience) is present at each table.</i></p> <p><i>So, please join us January 29th at 18.30pm in Antwerp (at Idealabs) as (preferably 'equiped') enterpreneur or lean startup coach. If you could please RSVP on Meetup to let us know if you will be able to attend, as we will have some snacks and refreshments for those who are available to come. I'm sure you won't mind contributing to the catering costs (10 \u20ac - to be paid at the entrance).</i></p> <p>Important: at the start of the evening, we will give an intro of a half an hour on the Business Model Canvas/Lean Canvas for the non-equiped/non-knowledgeable.

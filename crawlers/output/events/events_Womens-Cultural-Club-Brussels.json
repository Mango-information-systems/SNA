More than forty modern and contemporary artists have been invited for this exhibition, which will subsequently be shown to the public in the Museum of Limoges.<br/>While blue was regarded as a \u0093barbaric\u0094 colour in Greek and Roman Antiquity, the East already used it in art as well as in everyday life, be it for religious rituals, dyeing textiles, decorating ceramics and glass, or the ornamentation of precious jewellery.<br/>Known as anil, indigo gave its name to the Nile, the \u0093blue river\u0094 of Egypt, where the colour was thought to bring good fortune in the afterlife. Turquoise was dedicated to Hathor, goddess of motherhood, and the god Horus\u0092 pectoral is of a deep blue, symbolizing the healing eye as well as the sun.<br/>In Persia, it was thought that the world rested on a sapphire giving the sky its radiance, while in ancient China blue was attributed the medicinal properties of the indigo plant and was used in the manufacture of paper, clothes and porcelain. The Tibetans, for their part, treasured turquoises as a charm protecting water and springs.</p> <p>If the East has long regarded blue as endowed with certain virtues, curiously it was not until the 12th century that Europe gradually appreciated the colour, which hitherto had only been described in a poor language. But since more modern times, Blue has found its rightful place in the West, to the point of becoming, ahead of red and green the world\u0092s favourite colour, symbolizing dreams, wisdom and serenity. Henceforth, blue is ubiquitous: associated with the purity of water, the infinity of the heavens and seas, divine and royal right, work clothes and jeans of all generations, the works of Impressionist and Fauve artists to those of Matisse and Yves Klein. Blue is colour adorned with many attributes and there are countless expressions that give meaning to its thousands of shades\".</p> <p>Alongside works by major artists such as<br/>Pierre Alechinsky, Yves Klein and Joan Mir\u00f3</p> <p>Prices<br/>Standard admission price: 10 \u20ac<br/>7 \u20ac per person for groups of 8 or more<br/>8 \u20ac per person (students, teacher and for 65s)</p>", "created": 1387108781000, "venue": {"city": "1050 Brussels", "name": "Villa Empain", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.384368, "address_1": "Avenue Franklin Roosevelt 67", "country": "be", "lat": 50.80751, "id": 2218172}, "updated": 1389460092000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 11, "time": 1389448800000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "155605042", "name": "BOGHOSSIAN FOUNDATION"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 1, "average": 5}, "utc_offset": 3600000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Womens-Cultural-Club-Brussels/events/158151062/", "group": {"who": "the culties", "name": "Women's Cultural Club Brussels", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "approval", "created": 1383688022000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Womens-Cultural-Club-Brussels", "id": 10985042}, "description": "<p>Tim Porter is a Canadian photographer, he has travelled and photographed extensively in Japan and parts of<br/>Asia, India and the South Pacific.

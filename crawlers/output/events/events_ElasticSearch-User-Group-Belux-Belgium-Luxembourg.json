Most of the decisions can be altered along the line (refresh interval, number of replicas), but one stands out as permanent - number of shards. Many developers feel the pressure of making the right choice in regards to the number of shards they will use when creating an index. But with a base line of what the maximum shard size is and knowing how much data needs to be stored in elasticsearch, the choice of number of shards becomes much easier.</p> <p>Meetup participants that come up with challenging questions or add their own use case will get a surprise gift. There will be Elasticsearch stickers too, to spread Bonsai happiness in the Big Data universe.</p> <p><br/>In a nice gesture to help gender balance our meetup, Elasticsearch throws in some limited edition ladies cut\u00a0t-shirts. \"Elastic ladies\" whom attend will get priority, but gentlemen that fancy ladies cut tees and want to out their love for Elasticsearch will not be excluded :)</p>", "created": 1380291178000, "rsvp_limit": 30, "venue": {"city": "1040 Brussel-Bruxelles", "name": "ICAB Business & Technology Incubator", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.35171, "address_1": "Witte Patersstraat 4 rue de Peres Blancs", "country": "be", "lat": 50.850338, "id": 5720232}, "updated": 1385108973000, "visibility": "public", "how_to_find_us": "Same \"AZZAR\" room as last meetup.

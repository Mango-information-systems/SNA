So many people make New Year resolutions and that\u2019s it. They never follow through on them and then find themselves the following January making the same resolutions again. And, so the cycle continues.</p> <p><b>Getting back on course</b><br/>Many people feel that the events of September 2008 pushed them way off course and 2009 is a year that most of us would probably prefer to forget. This intensive seminar will take you through a structured process for getting back on track to make 2010 your best year yet.</p> <p><b>Are you planning to fail?</b><br/>Most professionals recognize the need to have clear goals and to plan. The old saying: \u201cFail to plan, plan to fail\u201d comes to mind. However, it\u2019s often the one thing that professionals admit they don\u2019t really do often enough. We will go beyond traditional goal setting and teach you how to create well-formed outcomes and action plans that really work.</p> <p><b>Do you know where you are?</b><br/>We chose the metaphor of a Compass because it is an instrument that is really good at letting you know where you\u2019re at relative to where you want to go. However, often when a Compass comes into contact with certain substances that interfere with its workings, it needs to be reset.</p> <p><br/><b>Tried &amp; tested for you</b></p> <p>We have designed this seminar to ensure that:</p> <p>\u2022 you get time to reflect on the things that are important to you in your life and begin to focus on the things you want more of<br/>\u2022 you eliminate all obstacles from your past that prevent you from achieving your goals today<br/>\u2022 you create the future that you know you can achieve<br/>\u2022 you improve all your relationships<br/>\u2022 you know how to achieve financial independence</p> <p>At the end of this seminar you will have reconnected with your true purpose in life and have the tools, resources, motivation and confidence to achieve anything you set your mind to.</p> <p><br/><b>Investment Price:</b> \u20ac675*</p> <p><b>Early Bird Price:</b> \u20ac495* (if registered and paid before 31st December 2009)</p> <p><i>*excluding VAT/TVA/BTW</i></p> <p>The seminar will be led by two leading NLP trainers: Gerry Murray &amp; Bryce Redford.</p> <p><b>Coming soon (dates tbc): Accelerated NLP Practitioner training</b><br/>First in Belgium.

People are often stunned by just how much of what we communicate takes place out of our conscious awareness.</p> <p>Body language literature has a tendency to over-generalize gestures and this is not useful in all contexts. In NLP we are taught to calibrate a range of non-verbal behavior without mind-reading what this may or may not mean for the other person. Therefore, we rely as much on the context as the words, gestures, etc. to enable us to establish meaning. This is particularly useful when working one-on-one with others in a coaching, mentoring or managing situation and dealing with groups of people.</p> <p><b>Walking the talk...</b></p> <p><b>\u00a0</b>An area of particular interest is how to get leaders to walk their talk. Employees often perceive a mismatch between the words that leaders use and their subsequent actions. How can you make leaders more aware of their non-verbal behavior and teach them some ways to be more flexible and congruent in the messages they are sending out? Therefore, we will explore two ends of a spectrum: <i><b>credible</b></i> vs <i><b>approachable</b></i> and the non-verbals that typically accompany these.</p> <p>Certain gestures will reliably create predictable responses when used in our daily informal communication or indeed in more formal communication settings such as giving a presentation. So, it can be important to know about these.</p> <p>This seminar will be quite experimental in nature as we test out some new exercises that make us more aware of our own non-verbal behaviors.

I know from personal experience that this model not only will enable someone with spelling difficulties to improve their spelling it can have a transformative effect on how they learn.</p> <p>Here's how I know...</p> <p><i>My 2nd daughter, Hannah, was told by her English teacher when she was 7 that she was mildly dyslexic - I'll explain why applying this label to a child of 7 can seriously handicap that child's learning abilities for the rest of their life! Whilst most of the kids in her class were getting 20 words to spell each week Hannah was only getting 10 words. Moreover, she was only getting 2 or 3 out of 10 correct on each test. Her overall grades on most subjects fluctuated between C+ and B.</i></p> <p><i>So, one Sunday afternoon in preparation for her spelling test on the following Wednesday I taught her the NLP Spelling Strategy. Within one hour she could spell all 10 words correctly. On the Wednesday she scored 10/10 in her test. We repeated the Spelling Strategy each Sunday for the next few weeks and she repeatedly scored 10/10 on the subsequent tests.</i></p> <p><i>Within a year Hannah was looking forward to the annual spellathon of +/-150 words and got nearly all of them correct. The most remarkable thing was that her grades across all subjects went up to a range of B to A!</i></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>We'll also test out strategies for remembering people's names, etc..</p> <p>So, if you're really curious about the power of NLP to change lives and want to learn more then this is one seminar that you'll want to attend...</p> <p><b>Important Information</b></p> <p><b>Register:</b> Either via Meetup or by clicking this <a href=\"http://gerrymurray.com/index.html\">link</a></p> <p><b>Sign in:</b> 18:00</p> <p><b>Start:</b> 18:30</p> <p><b>Finish:</b> 21:00</p> <p>We often continue afterwards for a social drink at a nearby cafe...</p> <p>\u00a0</p>", "created": 1324654290000, "rsvp_limit": 17, "venue": {"city": "1040 Brussels", "name": "Aloft Brussels Schuman", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.379961, "address_1": "Place Jean Rey", "country": "be", "lat": 50.840488, "id": 1561787}, "updated": 1330626885000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 1, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/NLP-in-Brussels/events/45319912/", "time": 1330621200000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "45319912", "name": "Learning Strategies"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 1, "average": 3}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/NLP-in-Brussels/events/49388152/", "group": {"who": "Amazing People", "name": "NLP in Brussels", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "approval", "created": 1257408319000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "NLP-in-Brussels", "id": 1552065}, "description": "<p>An overview of organizational change and how to communicate this.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><b>Why should you attend?</b></p> <p>You want something to be different but don't know how to begin You believe you need to make some mindset changes at work and are not sure where to start You want to improve how you communicate change You're planning some changes in your department/division and need a better process Your organization is going through a change process right now and you want a better understanding of what's involved and how to deal with it You want to understand the impact that new tools/processes such as social media can have on organizations You want to learn something new \u00a0</p> <p><b>What will we cover?</b></p> <p>You will be introduced to change management methodologies and we'll explore the role of mindset and thinking styles in effecting change.

This modeling project produced one of the most powerful NLP language models, The Milton Model. Hypnotic language patterns are the dominant form of communication in most organizations. CEO's are highly skilled at these as are trade union leaders and politicians.</p> <p>Hypnotic states, also known as trance or altered states, are frequently misunderstood and there are many myths and untruths about Hypnosis. Few people realize that they go into a hypnotic state about every 20 minutes and this is often referred to as Day Dreaming. Others go into the TV trance, whilst watching TV - ever tried to get someone's attention when they are \"glued\" to the television?! In fact, hypnotic states are perfectly natural and a necessary way for us to get through our daily activities.</p> <p><b>Join Antonia Harrison for a short seminar on April 26th and explore the myths and truth of hypnosis.</b></p> <p>Hypnosis can help you <b>bring positive change to your life</b> using the unlimited power of your own unconscious mind whether you want to give up an unwanted habit e.g. smoking, nail-biting, stuttering, overcome a limiting fear or phobia e.g. heights, flying, spiders or that most terrifying of all: fear of public speaking!

For professional communicators, this can be a real challenge.</p> <p>With all the social media hype you may have thoughts and feelings such as:</p> <p>o Am I missing out on something valuable for my personal and career development?</p> <p>o Do we really need social media in our organization?</p> <p>o If I were to know, how could I convince key stakeholders such as my CEO of its value?</p> <p>o Perhaps there are good reasons why we should not adopt social media</p> <p>It seems to be all or nothing.

Your learning will be supported by case studies and the latest research available.</p> <p><br/>A practical workbook complements this unique learning experience.<br/>Your learning doesn\u2019t stop after attending this event.

It enables you to familiarize yourself with basic concepts, tools and techniques and work through some pre-classroom exercises.

The classroom training part is an interactive experience that combines theory with practical exercises. All learning styles are catered for guaranteeing that you\u2019ll find it easy to learn. Skills are taught in layers with each layer building on the previous one. Therefore, you create a solid foundation during the first day on which you develop your skills. You will be able to experience the immediate difference in your performance as a speaker/presenter.</p> <p>5.

We'll also introduce\u00a0Ericksonian Hypnosis as a further enhancement and deal with many of the myths and common misunderstandings of hypnosis and altered states of consciousness.</p> <p><b>NLP Coaching</b></p> <p>NLP Coaching goes beyond many other coaching methods in its ability to combine traditional coaching approaches with modelling excellence. It is highly generative and goes further than simply improving behaviours. Thus, for a client it involves two simultaneous outcomes: learning both\u00a0<i>what</i> to do and <i>how</i> to do it.\u00a0</p> <p>As an NLP coach your mission is to teach your clients how to fish for themselves by building self-awareness, empowering them to take responsibility for their own results and guiding them to access their own resources to be able to achieve what they want in life.</p> <p>So, if you're curious about how to achieve this and what's in the NLP Coach's Toolbox this will be relevant to you.</p> <p><b>Time Line Therapy\u00ae</b></p> <p><br/>Three simple things can often explain why we\u2019re not getting what we want in life:</p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Ineffective strategies that produce variable results</p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Unresolved Negative Emotions from the Past</p> <p>\u00b7\u00a0 Limiting Beliefs in the Present</p> <p>NLP can assist you with all three of these. Time Line Therapy\u00ae is the most effective, easiest and fastest way to deal with unresolved negative emotions and limiting beliefs. It is a valuable addition to a Coach's toolbox as often a client's ability to get benefits from coaching is severely restricted by not addressing these two aspects of their life. A typical example would be <i>fear</i>. Once all negative emotions and limiting beliefs have been cleaned up, the way is open for you and your clients to get more of what you want in life.</p> <p><b>Ericksonian Hypnosis</b></p> <p>Named after the renowned Hypnotherapist Milton Erickson, Ericksonian Hypnosis is an indirect permissive approach to hypnotherapy that enables a client to access altered or trance states for the purposes of improving communication with their unconscious resources. It can assist people in getting rid of unwanted habits such as smoking, dealing with dis-ease or installing new and more effective strategies for an improved life.</p> <p>In developing NLP, Richard Bandler and John Grinder derived the Milton Model by modeling Milton Erickson's approach to trance work and his skill in using language, metaphor and non-verbal communication.</p> <p><b>Is this seminar for me?</b></p> <p>Yes. If you're interested in learning about NLP. If you're already a coach and want to explore how NLP can make you an even better coach. If you're a therapist and want to enhance your therapeutic skills.

Work affects your private life and your private life affects your work. So, to apply these skills at work you need to be able to <b><i>apply them to our life as a whole</i></b>.\u00a0</p> <p>Coaching is becoming an essential leadership skill.

To host a session, anybody can pitch a topic to the crowd. Sessions are generally participatory in nature, typically without powerpoint. SenseCampers vote with their feet and leave sessions they do not want to participate in. The format blurs traditional notions of speakers and listeners and creates a highly interactive experience of shared learning and development.</p> <p>For more info get on bxlsensecamp.strkingly.com</p> <p>Get your ticket at <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/brussels-sense-camp-tickets-12262977897\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/brussels-sense-camp-tickets-12262977897</a> ( The members who organise the sense camp are volunteers, the ticket is like a donation that will serve to pay for the expenses like the location, food, drinks, and others expenses )</p> <p>Put on your super hero cape and come to help us solve challenges !</p>", "created": 1407247070000, "updated": 1411208024000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 15, "time": 1411196400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "199122842", "name": "Sensecamp"}]

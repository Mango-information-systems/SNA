This talk will be broken up into two parts. First I'll talk about how in the past few years, HBase has been deployed in production at companies like Facebook, Pinterest, Groupon, and eBay and about the vibrant community of contributors from around the world include folks at Cloudera, Salesforce.com, Intel, HortonWorks, Yahoo!, and XiaoMi.\u00a0Second I'll talk about the features in the newest release 0.96.x and in the upcoming 0.98.x release.</p> <p><b>Jon Hsieh</b>, Software Engineer @ Cloudera and HBase Committer/PMC Member</p> <p>--------</p> <p><br/><b>Apache Sqoop: Unlocking Hadoop for Your Relational Database</b><br/>Unlocking data stored in an organization's RDBMS and transferring it to Apache Hadoop is a major concern in the big data industry. Apache Sqoop enables users with information stored in existing SQL tables to use new analytic tools like Apache HBase and Apache Hive. This talk will go over how to deploy and apply Sqoop in your environment as well as transferring data from MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Netezza, Teradata, and other relational systems. In addition, we'll show you how to keep table data and Hadoop in sync by importing data incrementally as well as how to customize transferred data by calling various database functions.</p> <p><br/><b>Kate Ting</b>, Technical Account Manager @ Cloudera and Sqoop Committer/PMC Member, co-author of the Apache Sqoop Cookbook</p>", "created": 1386597339000, "rsvp_limit": 70, "venue": {"city": "Brussel", "name": "Accenture", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.359761, "address_1": "Waterloolaan 16", "country": "be", "lat": 50.8382, "id": 4588842}, "updated": 1396774099000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 70, "time": 1396627200000, "waitlist_count": 4, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "154725422", "name": "22nd meetup - Cloudera on HBase and Sqoop"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 4, "average": 4.5}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/bigdatabe/events/173968552/", "group": {"who": "Big Data geeks", "name": "BigData.be", "group_lat": 50.880001068115234, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1307647386000, "group_lon": 4.699999809265137, "urlname": "bigdatabe", "id": 1995941}, "description": "<p>Our 23rd meetup will be a presentation style meetup in Ghent (details of the location will be communicated asap)</p> <p><br/>Following presentations have been confirmed:</p> <p>1) Introduction to the Brussels Datascience Meetup group by Philippe Van Impe (30 min)</p> <p><br/>Philippe will introduce what data science is all about, the projects they are working on (with possible links to big data), their link to the non-profit <a href=\"http://www.datakind.org\"><a href=\"http://www.datakind.org\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.datakind.org</a></a> organization (data for good) and how both groups could collaborate.\u00a0</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Brussels-Data-Science-Community-Meetup/\"><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Brussels-Data-Science-Community-Meetup/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/Brussels-Data-Science-Community-Meetup/</a></a>\u00a0</p> <p>2) Introduction to ElasticSearch by Eric Rodriguez (45 min)</p> <p>Are you looking for a scalable search engine?

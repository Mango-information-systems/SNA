All the books that you need to change your life have already been written! You just need to <b>set aside time every day to read</b> them. To help you in this task, we're offering a regular book club discussion on a great selection of personal development/self help books. So come along and join us.</p> <p>This month, we're reading <b>\"You'll See It When You Believe It\" by Wayne Dyer</b>.<br/>To order the book, click <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1hfyUK4\">here</a>.<br/>Read the book in advance at least once (more times is even better). During the meeting, we will discuss different sections of the book, focusing on those parts that have captured our attention the most, and also expressing our own feelings and insights in relation to the material. No previous experience of the genre is required. What is required is a clear and open mind, and plenty of enthusiasm!</p> <p>\n\n<b>Book Club schedule:</b><br/>Doors open: 19:15<br/>Starts: 19:30<br/>Ends: 21:00<br/>Cost: FREE</p>", "created": 1403971705000, "updated": 1415255502000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 4, "time": 1415903400000, "duration": 5400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "191817242", "name": "Book Club discussion: \"You'll See It When You Believe It\""}, {"status": "upcoming", "utc_offset": 3600000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/The-Brussels-Own-Your-Life-Meetup-Group/events/187758932/", "group": {"who": "Own My Lifers", "name": "The Brussels Own Your Life Meetup Group", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1398943242000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "The-Brussels-Own-Your-Life-Meetup-Group", "id": 14210442}, "description": "<p><b>Think!

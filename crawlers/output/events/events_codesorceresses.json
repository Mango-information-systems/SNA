It is even worse than in the JavaScript or Python world. Or is this just an illusion? Are the female Java developers there, but just not joining conferences and user groups? What about female speakers at Java conferences?</p> <p>Part 1) Discussion of multiple issues: - Is this perception correct and, if yes, why is this the case? - Should we address it by promoting women in the Java eco system or should we let the situation \"resolve\" itself? - Why the amount of female speakers at Java conferences is so small? What can we do about this?</p> <p>Part 2) The BOF will also propose some projects ideas that may help to improve the situation. Its aim is to come up with concrete ideas and projects (that's why part 1 will be limited in time).</p> <p>Ex.: A directory of female speakers in the IT world. Such a project will it make easier for conference committees to find female speakers and it may also inspire more women to become speakers.Ex.: Speaker mentoring program - get trained by experienced speakers or test yourself with co-trainees in Hangouts.Your ideas!

VVVV is widely used for artistic installations, generative design and product showcases.</p> <p><br/>VVVV is a general purpose toolkit with a special focus on real-time <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_graphics\">motion graphics</a> (interactive AfterEffect like rendering in real-time) and large media environments with physical interfaces (arduino, kinect\u2026).</p> <p>In VVVV, applications (patches) are visually programmed. You add nodes (boxes that do stuff) to your patch (network of nodes) and link nodes together to make them interact. Patches can be created, edited and tested while they are running.</p> <p><br/>VVVV is used for:</p> <p>\u2022 Motion graphic &amp; design <a href=\"http://vvvv.org/blog/live-with-miracalix-excerpts\">[1]</a>, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/groups/vvvv/videos/69850569\">[2]</a> (for instance for VJing <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/50802469\">[3]</a>).</p> <p>\u2022 Installations (artistic projects <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/34756702\">[4]</a>, product showcasing <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/groups/vvvv/videos/69008243\">[5]</a>, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/groups/vvvv/videos/69461895\">[6]</a>, mapping <a href=\"http://vvvv.org/blog/birdroom\">[7]</a>, <a href=\"http://vvvv.org/blog/affinity-afinidad\">[8]</a>)</p> <p>\u2022 Design (generative design <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/2525839\">[9]</a>, <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/5485415\">[10]</a>, data visualisation <a href=\"http://vvvv.org/blog/meso-bmwi-energy-efficiency-roadshow-2009\">[11]</a>, <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/86413361\">[12]</a>, new interfaces <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/36244015\">[13]</a>, <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/11294955\">[14]</a>)</p> <p><br/>During this workshop, you will learn the basics of patching (programming in VVVV), how &lt;a href=\"http://vimeo.com/27463592\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;to navigate the VVVV ecosystem/toolkit in order to create interactive visuals &amp; installations.

Come learn how to beautifully visualize data. You will learn how to parse data, make a story out of it, and basics of its visualization. For that, we'll discover Processing, a programming language with an emphasis on visuals and interactions. With little tweaking, your end result will be an interactive visualization that run on computer, on Android and even straight on the web.</p> <p>First you'll learn the basics of the Processing programming language, designed to facilitate the use of software within the visual arts, and to promote visual representations within technology. Processing is focused on making digital creation simple and fun. This makes it particularly fitted for makers, designers and visual artists from all level.</p> <p>Once our first batch of skills acquired, we'll try our hands on some data visualization. From getting the data online, parsing it, getting its essence, to representing it in a fitted way so that the user can comprehend it better. We'll ask ourselves questions, and if data alone can't answer us properly, our visualization will. While we will have material to guide you, you are free to explore personal direction within this frame. If you have specific data or questions, don't hesitate to focus on those and see how what you learn can be applied to your personal project.</p> <p>During this workshop, you will learn the basics of programming, how to use Processing and its development environment to create data representations that people can interact with. By the end of the workshop, we hope to make you autonomous with Processing so you can start your own projects.</p> <p><b>Requirement</b>:</p> <p>1) Bring your laptop (Windows, Mac or Linux, no problem)<br/>2) Optional: Download and set up Processing on your machine.</p> <p><b>Lead Coach:</b> <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/OpenTechSchool-Brussels/members/94547592\">Roman Miletitch</a></p> <p><b>Coaches:</b> No other yet, tell me if interested in coaching!</p> <p><b>Materials:</b> <a href=\"http://opentechschool-brussels.github.io/data-visualisation-with-processing/\"><a href=\"http://opentechschool-brussels.github.io/data-visualisation-with-processing/\" class=\"linkified\">http://opentechschool-brussels.github.io/data-visualisation-with-processing/</a></a></p>", "created": 1411833769000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "Labokube", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.38024, "address_1": "Chauss\u00e9e de Louvain 242", "country": "be", "lat": 50.850121, "id": 19428452}, "updated": 1413367072000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 38, "time": 1413028800000, "duration": 14400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "209869712", "name": "Data visualisation with Processing"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 1, "average": 5}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/OpenTechSchool-Brussels/events/212034192/", "group": {"who": "Members", "name": "OpenTechSchool Brussels", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1374496023000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "OpenTechSchool-Brussels", "id": 9462812}, "description": "<p>The workshop is about creating a smartphone app using Android.

You will first learn how to code simple robotics behavior, from navigation and obstacle avoidance to collaboration among robots.</p> <p>Once basic skills acquired, your aim will be to create specific Artificial Intelligences and confront them with the ones of fellow learners in various multi-player setup.</p> <p>While those experiments are played as game, they will take place in ARGoS Simulator, providing you with rigorous scientific conditions.

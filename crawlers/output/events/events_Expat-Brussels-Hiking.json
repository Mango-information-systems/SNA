For 8 people, we need only two cars. Arjen provides one, so we'll need someone else to also drive. The drivers will be compensated for the cost by their fellow passengers, of course. To make sure we'll be efficient, we'll determine the meetup point for each car based on where the driver and the passengers live. Arjen will coordinate this. It also means we'll need people to commit to the hike and not cancel only a few days/hours before.</p> <p><b>Why/What is an 'experienced hikers only' walk</b>?</p> <p><br/>- Because of the difficulty of the terrain we want to only walk with maximum 8 people so that we can move at a reasonable pace. We want people who are able to do this hike without a problem.</p> <p><br/>- This area is best/only reachable by car. This requires more planning and we do not want people to cancel their RSVPs on the last moment and leave seats open in the cars.</p> <p>- This is the first time I'm doing a more difficult hike/planning with a group</p> <p><br/>To join this hike, please RSVP to this hike and answer the few extra questions. The secret word is peanut-butter-jelly-time btw. Then, everyone will be placed on the waiting list.

Villers-la-Ville is probably the one of closest-by, middle-of-nowhere backwaters with a train station. Only every two hours there is a train to the village and there are no buses on sunday. So it is a really small village, but in typical Belgium style, there are three somewhat-expensive restaurants, a bakery, and a butcher. There may be even a frituur kot, although I don't see it in Google streetview/maps.</p> <p><br/>After leaving the village, we will walk through a forest. We will see a Ferme du Moulin, whatever that is, and Chateau Cocriamont.\u00a0 Here, we will turn north, go through a small patch of open fields, and into another forest. We will stay almost the full way to La Roche in this forest. We cross the railroad and go into a more hilly forest area. We will keep on walking this hilly area until we reach the abbey of Villers-la-Ville. To enter the grounds of the abbey you to pay an entrance fee, but we will hike around it, so that is for free.</p> <p><br/>It is now a ruin, but used to be a beautiful 13th century Cistercian abbey. The Cistercian are an order following the teaching of St. Benedict and didn't like the way the Benedictines order was developing. The Cisterians returned to a focus of manual labor. Furthermore they had a keen interest in technology. They especially improved farming, hydraulic and metallurgy methods all though out Europe.</p> <p><br/>Btw, a reform of the Cisterian order in the 17th century are the now famous beer makers, the Trappists. But at that time the Villers abbey was already in a large decline due to money problems and a failure to stick to the original teachings of st. Benedict as well.</p> <p><br/>On the site there is no beer, but there are a few bars in the area. From here it is a short track to the station.</p> <p><br/>I prefer to walk on quiet, unpaved roads if possible. There are plenty of those here. There may be mud.</p> <p><b>How to get there:</b></p> <p>Meet at Brussels Central Station at 10:30 at the latest, with your train tickets ready.

They claim this area apparently '<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jw5K2cx8oV8\">het Maaskantje</a>' of Belgium (they wish!). According to a (sadly removed) wikipedia-page this area is full of soccer hooligans, pimped-out cars, XTC, and low-lifes. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCEe6fO4Pa4\">Jumpstyle</a> also originated here. Jumpstyle is, of course, the slower/Belgium variant of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-urnurSHFg\">gabber</a> (When watching this movie I want to back to that hall again) But we will hike only on the border of the triangle and see lots of nature.</p> <p>We will walk a long while next to the Demer river, but also through forests and through hopefully heather areas (at least in name). We will see the Maagdentoren of Zichem, a tower nobody really knows why it was build. Furthermore, we will see the begijnhof of Aarschot.</p> <p><br/><b>How to get there:</b></p> <p>Meet at Brussels Central Station at 09h45 at the latest, with your train tickets ready - Wessel will be there.

Here we will follow the river Wurm into Aachen. It is a small meandering river that has it source just south of Aachen and enters the Rur up north. Its name comes from the word warm but this time of year it is still not a good idea to fall into it. For this part of the hike, prepare for mud.</p> <p>We enter Aachen from the north. Aachen has the oldest cathedral of Northern Europe, the <i>Kaiserdom</i>, where the throne of Charlemagne resides. They have a beautiful city hall dated 13:30, luscious <i>Aachener printen</i> bakeries and the easy going <i>Weihnachtsmark</i>t. Have some <i>gluwein</i> and <i>currywurst</i>!</p> <p><br/>In addition, the <i>Lindt Werksverkauf</i> is open this day. This is a chocolate shop of the size of a regular supermarket and probably very crowded. It is however 15 minutes walking out of the center. Still interesting to see.</p> <p><br/><b>How to get there:</b></p> <p>Take the 9:28 Thalys from Brussel Midi to Aachen. Then take the local train to Herzogenrath at 11:02 on gate 1.

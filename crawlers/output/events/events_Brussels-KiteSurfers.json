We've had an excellent weather last weekend with many riders for fun and enjoying the day at the beach. If you're interested we can manage a meetup at the beach of Oostvoorne (restaurants, toilets and warm showers available) for those looking for lessons and some of you who want to kitesurf with their own equipment. We can manage carpooling for those of you who don't have a car and a camping is possible for the whole weekend stay. Please let me know how many of you are interested. Hope to meet you soon.

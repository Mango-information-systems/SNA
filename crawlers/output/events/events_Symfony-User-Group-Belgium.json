It puts the domain model in the center of the system, happily ignorant of the infrastructure around it. But as soon as you try to build even a simple application, using some of the patterns and ideas from DDD, you tend to get stuck. The framework begins to fight back. It seems it has a will of its own, and it dictates how you should structure your code. Is a strong, independent domain model just a theoretical ideal?<br/>You can have both the benefits of framework, and the freedom to model to your needs. In this session, I\u2019ll show some practical patterns to decouple your model from your infrastructure.</p> <p><b>About the speaker:</b><br/>Mathias Verraes is a recovering music composer turned programmer, consultant, blogger, speaker, and podcaster. He advises companies on how to build enterprise web applications for complex business domains . For some weird reason, he enjoys working on large legacy projects: the kind where there\u2019s half a million lines of spaghetti code, and nobody knows how to get the codebase under control. He\u2019s the founder of the Domain-Driven Design Belgium community. When he\u2019s not working, he\u2019s at home in Kortrijk, Belgium, helping his two sons build crazy Lego train tracks. \u00a0</p> <p><b>Talk:\u00a0Symfony with Vagrant and Ansible</b><br/>Developing on your local computer is great until you have the \"But it work on my machine!\" problem. You are probably used to just use your local apache with MySQL and/or some bundled LAMP system and playing with your hosts file, but what when you need some specific libraries, you need to test some specific network configuration, you are working with a team of Windows, Mac, Linux and BeOS people? Using Vagrant and Ansible will help you to abstract the sysadmin part, and to put everyone in the exact same configuration. With the Ansible playbooks, you will go one step further and create stories. Ansible is also great for symfonians has it use the Jinja2 template engine from which Twig is originally based.</p> <p><b>About the speaker:</b><br/>Jean-Christophe Cuvelier is passionate by computers from when he got his first Commodore 64 computer.\u00a0Nowadays he is busy building Pictawall, the next tool for brands and events, build on Symfony. He has also a long experience in the need of doing everything since he's the developer/sysadmin behind his agency, Morris &amp; Chapman.\u00a0</p> <p>See you there!</p> <p><br/>app/console cache:clear --new-year --env=dev</p>", "created": 1389116185000, "venue": {"city": "Gent", "name": "Wijs", "repinned": false, "lon": 3.727986, "address_1": "Voorhavenlaan 31/003", "country": "be", "lat": 51.080212, "id": 17756662}, "updated": 1391159501000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 37, "time": 1391018400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 37, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "159198152", "name": "Symfony New Year Meetup"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 5, "average": 3.799999952316284}, "utc_offset": 3600000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Symfony-User-Group-Belgium/events/169953362/", "group": {"who": "Symfonians", "name": "Symfony User Group Belgium", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1384002598000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Symfony-User-Group-Belgium", "id": 11031632}, "description": "<p>Hi there!</p> <p>Our next meetup will happen in the fabulous city of Antwerpen, so, be ready to enjoy a great evening, thanks to <a href=\"http://inuits.eu/\">INUITS</a>.</p> <p><b>Agenda:</b></p> <p>19h00 - 19h30: Welcoming<br/>19h30 - 20h20: Talk: Follow the white rabbit, Message queues with PHP by Eric Rodriguez\u00a0<br/>20h20 - 21h30: Lessons learned/Hands On/SF debug/New speaker ?<br/>21h30 - 23h : Drinks, Symfony Q&amp;A, ...</p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b>Follow the white rabbit, Message queues with PHP</b><br/>An introduction to message queues with PHP.

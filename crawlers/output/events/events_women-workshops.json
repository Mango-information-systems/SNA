We love the masculine but we\u2019ve created too much of a good thing. If feminine energy, in women, in men and in society at large has been repressed, then, in part, it\u2019s because we\u2019ve allowed that to happen, even if only at a very unconscious level. It\u2019s our responsibility to rise as women and to rediscover what we have to give.</p> <p>As women, we're designed, through our very bodies, to literally hold space within which new life can be created. These days though, the world needs both <b>holding</b> and <b>creativity</b> on a much larger scale. Let's use our extraordinary capacities: let's collectively hold space for humanity as a whole. Leadership, in this 21st century will often be invisible. These monthly gatherings of sharing and guided meditation are your chance to make a difference, right here, right now.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><b>Women need to sit in circles, not only for the purpose of healing, but because we also need replenishment.\u00a0Women need to go deep.\u00a0 Sitting in circle nourishes the soul.</b><b>\u00a0</b></p> <p>There are many ways and many reasons to sit in circle. At its very core, a sacred circle of women is an opportunity to be loved and held in a way that only women can provide. The circle itself represents a sacred symbol that has been honored throughout time. It is a reminder of the sacredness of the circle of life, the seasons, sunrise to sunrise, the sun, moon, stars, and earth, all things round. This is a Women\u2019s Circle. This implies that we will be doing the reconnecting and rediscovering together. Just as leadership is often invisible, it is now also often collective. The sharing and the meditations will be guided, but the wisdom will emerge from the group as a whole. Our individual stories will reveal patterns that are present in the entire group, and that are important not just to us, but to women around the world. There is something magical about a circle. Geometrically it encompasses more space than any other shape. Within it, one sets out on a journey and returns having never left one\u2019s seat. Whenever we engage in an act of ritual or ceremony that has been shared throughout time, we are the beneficiary of all the goodness that has come from it. The circle, in and of itself, is imbued with lifetimes of profound wisdom. Circle also allows that everyone within the circle is equal. There is no hierarchy in circle. Everyone and every expression is equally valued. We learn so much from one another. We witness each other, allowing ourselves to be seen and heard, honoured, loved and enjoyed. These things go a long way toward strengthening us individually and collectively.</p> <p>What you may expect:\u00a0 Learn more about circle practice and story telling. Enter deeper into your female body through dance, stretching, free flow of movement, touch.\u00a0 This practice is to open our bodies to more of the feminine energy and receive nourishment from each other, strengthening, relaxing, healing and nourishing our bodies and souls. Rituals vary according to the season. We explore and practice being empowered, free and deeply feminine at the same time, holding the vision of a fully realized, awakened female expression on Earth.</p>", "created": 1350816058000, "rsvp_limit": 11, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "The Hub Brussels", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.362197, "address_1": "37 Rue du Prince Royal", "country": "be", "lat": 50.834651, "id": 1268412}, "updated": 1353150124000, "visibility": "public", "how_to_find_us": "The Hub Brussels", "yes_rsvp_count": 3, "time": 1353087000000, "duration": 14400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "87893742", "name": "Women's Circle - A monthly gathering to reconnect with our calling as women"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 3600000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/women-workshops/events/100356602/", "group": {"who": "Women, Sisters,", "name": "Women workshops & gatherings - to connect, heal and grow.", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1350814693000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "women-workshops", "id": 5487362}, "description": "<p>YOU are cordially invited to the next Women's Circle...</p> <p>\u00a0<b>Exploring the sacred\u2026</b></p> <p>In a circle of women we are exploring a sacred and real way of gathering together, being in \u201cthe temple of feminine flow\u201d.

The temple practices are designed by women for women, they are a spiritual practice that embraces and enhances our feminine nature, instead of asking us to deny or transcend it. In this embracing of our feminine nature we are restoring a natural balance between the masculine and the feminine within ourselves and in the world. We explore and practice being empowered, free and deeply feminine at the same time, holding the vision of a fully realized, awakened female expression on Earth.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/4/9/e/600_320682142.jpeg\" /></p>", "created": 1388739965000, "rsvp_limit": 6, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "Woluw\u00e9 St Pierre ", "repinned": false, "lon": 0, "address_1": "To be announced to registered participants only", "country": "be", "lat": 0, "id": 17609382}, "updated": 1390222912000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 6, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/women-workshops/events/158370932/", "time": 1389979800000, "duration": 14400000, "waitlist_count": 1, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "158370932", "name": "Women's circle"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 3600000, "fee": {"description": "per person", "required": "0", "accepts": "cash", "label": "Price", "currency": "EUR", "amount": 15}, "group": {"who": "Women, Sisters,", "name": "Women workshops & gatherings - to connect, heal and grow.", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1350814693000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "women-workshops", "id": 5487362}, "description": "<p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/1/5/e/600_325688542.jpeg\" /></p> <p>You are warmly invited to join the next Women\u2019s circle on <b>[masked]</b></p> <p><b>Exploring the sacred\u2026</b></p> <p>In a circle of women we are exploring a sacred and real way of gathering together, being in \u201cthe temple of feminine flow\u201d.

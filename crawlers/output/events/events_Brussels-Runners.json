This first section is ideal for beginners to be able to give the parade a try (Being able to brake sufficiently is advisable though!).</p> <p>After the break the pace can step up a little and some hills and tunnels can be found on the routes. Help is on hand for anyone getting into difficulties!</p> <p>The parade starts rolling at 8pm sharp (recommend you arrive some time before to be sure you're ready to move off!) and generally arrives back at the start point around 11pm. For those only wanting to do the first section, its not far from Toison d'Or back to the start point. For those<br/>who continue on, there is always a bus that you can hop on and off if you want to skip certain parts or just get too tired!</p> <p>Leading the pack is a disco truck that will provide plenty of watts of music power to give that party atmosphere!</p> <p>For the last few years the parade has also been joined by cyclists, long-boarder\u2019s and even unicyclist\u2019s! - this year will be no exception (the bike section follows the skaters), so even you can't or don't want to skate, you can still join in.</p> <p>These events are open to all, from kids to grand-parents!</p> <p>Safety first:<br/>The parade is flanked by staff (which I am a member of so look out for me!) and police who keep the traffic away and help to make sure no one is left behind. There are first aiders and even an ambulance (not wanting to scare!), should they be needed. Everything is done to ensure your safety, but take precautions. helmets and knee, elbow &amp; wrist guards are recommended kit. Best advice I can give for tackling hills is not to let your speed get above your comfort zone, start to brake before you feel you\u2019re out of control. Watch out for pot-holes in the road surface (occasionally we cross over tram-tracks and cobbles, these are kept to a minimum, but keep your eyes peeled \u2013 normally such parts of the course will be high-lighted by the staff).</p> <p>If you've never tried this then make sure to give it a go this year!</p> <p>For those without skates there is the possibility to rent (for a small fee) from the start point (look for the black van from \u2018TWIN\u2019 shop). I Recommend that you turn up early to ensure they have your size though.</p> <p>The weather is not always behaving in our favour, so be sure to check the website for the status.<br/>Each week around 6pm on the day the event will be confirmed or cancelled (if weather conditions are not appropriate) via the website:<br/>www.belgiumrollers.com</p> <p>You can also find further information (actually sometimes a little more accurate!) on <a href=\"http://www.rouliroula.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=295\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.rouliroula.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=295</a> This is the forum of the local skating club, mostly in French, but you can find most topics on here for anything skate related in the region.</p> <p>If anyone needs more information, then give me a call or send me an email.

The paths there are flat, smooth, obstacle free (away from traffic) and distance can be decided depending the group.<br/>I guess the aim of this is to reach out to those of you who have skates, want to skate, but are not as confident on them to tackle something like a Roller-Parade just yet. Being flat, no hills to worry about and with no major obstacles or need to have to stop rapidly, if you\u2019re ok to skate in a straight line un-aided, then this is just the sort of practice session you need\u2026 Should be a fun relaxed pace, that will allow you to build up your confidence/skill and I\u2019m available for any tips/advice if needs be.<br/>Only issue will be to get there \u2013 it\u2019s a car ride (though will check if its possible to find a start near a train station). I will have a couple of places in my car, but if someone else with a car is joining then all the better.<br/>Meeting point \u2013 by the White Knight at Montgomery round-about, 6.30pm (negotiable depending the group). Will take 20-30mins to get to the start point (depending the traffic conditions), but with the light nights, we should still have a good few hours available \u2013 will try to find a bar to have a drink or grab a bite afterwards :-)<br/>Recommend you wear a helmet and knee/elbow/wrist protections \u2013 don\u2019t forget your skates of course and maybe a small backpack for shoes and a bottle of water ;-)<br/>So come on \u2013 give it a try ;-)</p>", "created": 1371030761000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "White Knight", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.407359, "address_1": "Montgomery Square ", "country": "be", "lat": 50.837276, "id": 12804402}, "updated": 1372406224000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 13, "time": 1372350600000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "124231832", "name": "Skate by the canals near Mechelen - **CONFIRMED**"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Brussels-Runners/events/126300272/", "group": {"who": "Runners", "name": "Brussels Runners", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1303718291000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Brussels-Runners", "id": 1820198}, "description": "<p>We will do about 10k at a 10km/hr pace, and much of the route is on trails in the park.

The paths there are flat, smooth, obstacle free (away from traffic) and distance can be decided depending the group.<br/>The aim of this is to reach out to those of you who have skates, want to skate, but are not as confident on them to tackle something like a Roller-Parade just yet. Being flat, no hills to worry about and with no major obstacles or need to have to stop rapidly, if you\u2019re ok to skate in a straight line un-aided, then this is just the sort of practice session you need\u2026 Should be a fun relaxed pace, that will allow you to build up your confidence/skill and I\u2019m available for any tips/advice if needs be.<br/>Only issue will be to get there \u2013 it\u2019s a car ride (there is a possibility to take the train to Mechelen and start there, but will need to see about timings and the additional distance this will add to the skating). I will have places in my car, but if someone else with a car is joining then all the better.<br/>Meeting point \u2013 by the White Knight at Montgomery round-about, 6.30pm (negotiable depending the group). Will take 20-30mins to get to the start point (depending the traffic conditions), but with the light nights, we should still have a good few hours available \u2013 will try to find a bar to have a drink or grab a bite afterwards :-)<br/>Recommend you wear a helmet and knee/elbow/wrist protections \u2013 don\u2019t forget your skates of course and maybe a small backpack for shoes and a bottle of water ;-)<br/>So come on \u2013 give it a try ;-)</p> <p>The start point we're aiming for is:</p> <p>Battelse Bergen 4,<br/>2800 Mechelen (Google maps!)</p>", "created": 1375953249000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "White Knight", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.407359, "address_1": "Montgomery Square ", "country": "be", "lat": 50.837276, "id": 12804402}, "updated": 1376423041000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 5, "time": 1376411400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "133702602", "name": "Skate by the canals near Mechelen - 'part 2' - **CONFIRMED**"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Brussels-Runners/events/134317222/", "group": {"who": "Runners", "name": "Brussels Runners", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1303718291000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Brussels-Runners", "id": 1820198}, "description": "<p>We meet by the flag under the central arche</p>", "created": 1376301334000, "venue": {"city": "Brussel", "name": "Parc Cinquantenaire", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.389483, "address_1": "Jubelpark", "country": "be", "lat": 50.840804, "id": 705439}, "updated": 1376426878000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 11, "time": 1376415000000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "134317222", "name": "a few laps around 50nnaire"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 2, "average": 5}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Brussels-Runners/events/131311912/", "group": {"who": "Runners", "name": "Brussels Runners", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1303718291000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Brussels-Runners", "id": 1820198}, "description": "<p>Spend the August long weekend in one of the most stunning regions of Norway doing a range of outdoor activities.</p> <p>Check out:<br/><a href=\"http://www.visitnorway.com/en/Where-to-go/Fjord-Norway/Stavanger/What-to-do-in-the-Stavanger-Region/Attractions-in-the-Stavanger-Region/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.visitnorway.com/en/Where-to-go/Fjord-Norway/Stavanger/What-to-do-in-the-Stavanger-Region/Attractions-in-the-Stavanger-Region/</a></p> <p>Fly from Brussels to Stavanger via Amsterdam Wed evening and return Sunday evening.

The pace is relaxed (but steady) and approx. 80km per day \u2013 this is not as bad as it sounds with breaks along the way and long lunch breaks. Each day the tour ends at a pool complex where you can take a relaxing dip before enjoying a BBQ. Accommodation can be a hotel or like most, \u2018camping\u2019 in a sports hall \u2013 trust me you\u2019ll be tired and you won\u2019t care where you sleep! :-)<br/>The cost includes the organisation (which being German is excellent!), breakfast, your chosen accommodation type and the facilities at the end of each day. Lunch and Dinner is extra as well is the bus transfer back to your start point if required at the end of the 3 days.<br/>The routes are mostly flat very smooth roads, we\u2019re flanked by police who keep the traffic away from us and (like the roller-parades in Brussels) there\u2019s a huge truck at the front blasting out music. Your luggage is carried by truck and so you only have to carry what you want and are free to skate. A great atmosphere, and you\u2019ll feel great after doing it! If you can skate and are fit then you should be able to do this event no problem\u2026 Last year the weather was glorious and this event was wonderful!<br/>The site below is in German, but feel free to Google-translate or ask me if you want more info.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nrw-inlinetour.de/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.nrw-inlinetour.de/</a></p> <p>Incidentally the night before the tour there is RollNacht (Dusseldorf\u2019s equivalent to the roller-parades in Brussels) \u2013 this is a good start to the weekend (www.rollnacht.de).

Once the runner finishes the fun continues at the \"Color Festival\", where more color powder is thrown in the air, making every runner look like a walking rainbow.<br/>The first The Color Run\u2122 took place in Phoenix (US) in January 2012. That year more than 53 American cities hosted this event, giving[masked] runners the chance to take part in this unique concept. This year The Color Run\u2122 crosses over to Europe, with events in Germany, Netherlands, France and the UK. And for the first time \u2013 in Brussels!<br/>The organization of the Belgian The Color Run\u2122 is in the hands of Golazo sports, who organizes 28 running events in Belgium this year. Managing Director Christophe Impens: \u201cThe Color Run\u2122 is a fantastic experience that attracts hundreds of thousands runner worldwide. This sporty festival is part of our strategy as we like to approach our running events in an original manner. We are convinced that this concept will be hugely popular in Belgium. It is the perfect combination of fun and sport.\u201d<br/>Participants run or walk 5 km at their own tempo and can start freely between 14.30hrs and 16.30hrs. There will be no timing, this run is purely about having fun.

One day, we had an idea.</p> <p>Why not run at the same time just in different locations?<br/>We soon realised that this could in fact, be something really cool.<br/>That\u2019s how Worldwide Companion Run was born.</p> <p>In 2011 we had a humble 35 runners in 12 countries.<br/>In 2012 we had nearly 150 in close to 35 countries.<br/>And this year, we\u2019re aiming to make it much, much BIGGER.<br/>Our goal is at least 1000 runners in at least 100 cities and at least 50 countries.</p> <p>The concept is very simple:<br/>Wherever you are at 4PM GMT on the 27th of November 2013, run or walk 5k.<br/>The choice of the route is up to you.<br/>Get some friends to join you and make it funky. Yes, funky.<br/>Take some photos/videos of your run and share them with other runners from around the globe. Show us your running reality!</p> <p>How do you join in the fun?<br/>Spread the word by creating a Worldwide Companion Run event in your Meetup on 27 or 28th November (depending on where around the globe you are).<br/>Join our event on Facebook - this is the event\u2019s headquarters :-)<br/>Joining the event on Facebook will keep you in the loop and that\u2019s where we\u2019ll be posting the photos, videos and much more!<br/>Participate in this unique running movement!<br/>Some speculate that we could even move the Earth!<br/>We have also created a tool which will help you organise a group and put your spot on the map. To set up your run, please use our RunningHub Companion Tool. It will also work out the time for you and allow you to invite friends and if you wish so, open the run to other runners nearby. This way you can also promote your Meetup Group!</p> <p>Who\u2019s behind WCR2013?<br/>This event is organised entirely by WoRM runners for runners - no fees, no sponsors, no entry forms. Just you and the rest of the world. Together.<br/>Join in, pass it on and get involved. Whether you do it alone or with a group of 100+... the more the merrier!</p> <p>If you have any questions or would like some advice on how to prepare for WCR2013, feel free to drop me a line: [masked]</p> <p>Cheers from runningly awesome New Zealand,<br/>Ewa (aka Crazychick), Ash and Brent<br/>WoRM Runnership Team</p>", "created": 1382662038000, "updated": 1385579061000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 7, "time": 1385568000000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "147341102", "name": "Worldwide Companion Run"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 3600000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Brussels-Runners/events/153205002/", "group": {"who": "Runners", "name": "Brussels Runners", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1303718291000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Brussels-Runners", "id": 1820198}, "description": "<p>Its been a very long time since I have done a Saturday run and I really need to get back into it ... so, let's run a 10km.

I am a passionate orienteer, practicing this sport since many years. I recently came across this Meetup page, and thought a lot of people here could be interested in trying orienteering. I read that some of you already tried it in November, on the occasion of some orienteering races organised in the For\u00eat de Soignes: <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Brussels-Runners/events/146510462/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/Brussels-Runners/events/146510462/</a></p> <p>Orienteering is an outdoor adventure and navigation sport that combines two things: running and map reading. As it happens, every year during the spring and summer months small orienteering events are being organised in parks, forests and urban areas in and around Brussels. Every Friday evening an orienteering training is organised by one of the two Brussels based orienteering clubs (Alta\u00efr C.O. or Asub Orientation). These gatherings are perfect opportunities for beginners to discover the sport. Or in general for everyone, just to relax after the workweek, while enjoying a natural environment.</p> <p>The calendar can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.asub-orientation.org/challenge_ete/CalendrierChallengeete2014.html\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.asub-orientation.org/challenge_ete/CalendrierChallengeete2014.html</a></p> <p>Often people are a bit deterred by the map reading component. I would like to stress that the basics of orienteering are not difficult to pick up at all, and that initiators will be present to explain the fundamentals of map reading.</p> <p>At the events we organise there's always possibility to run or walk, alone or in group, with or without time registration. Free start between 18h and 19h15. Different courses are proposed: from 2 km to 7 km (\"as the crow flies\"). Entry fee is 3 euros.</p> <p>This friday for instance I am organising an orienteering session in For\u00eat de Soignes, in La Hulpe. Meetup place is the parking at Ferme du Chateau, Dr\u00e8ve de la Ram\u00e9e - 1410 La Hulpe.<br/><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/50%C2%B043'50.9%22N+4%C2%B027'03.5%22E/@50.730804,4.450977,2809m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.google.com/maps/place/50%C2%B043'50.9%22N+4%C2%B027'03.5%22E/@50.730804,4.450977,2809m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0</a></p> <p>So don't miss out on this occasion :) Every event is very approachable for novices. Runners who like running, trail running, and outdoor activities, will for sure appreciate orienteering too :) All you need is a pair of good running shoes, long trousers, and a spirit for adventure!</p> <p>Don't hesitate to contact me for any further information, here or via email ([masked])</p> <p>In September, on the occasion of Brussels Car Free Sunday, we also organize an orienteering race in Brussels City Centre.

Well, you will need to find a good friend to go with you as well, as rogaining is a team sport.</p> <p>The aim is to find as much checkpoints as possible within the 6h time limit.

In a rogaine, teams of 2-5 people choose which checkpoints to visit within a time limit with the intent of maximizing their score. Teamwork, endurance, competition and an appreciation for the natural environment are features of the sport. Championship rogaines are 24 hours long, however rogaines can be as short as 2 hours.

Starting will be by interval (every minute, like in cycling time trials). Normal running competitions are often organised on big avenues, but we on the other hand have the opportunity to organise our event right in the city centre. In a Car Free Brussels, this promises to be an exciting experience.</p> <p>The BOM offers a lot:<br/>- The map is understandable by all, and will cover the entire Brussels Pentagon.<br/>- We offer 9 different courses to choose from, going from 2,4km up to 9,6km.<br/>- You can run alone, but also in group, or you can choose to walk. All ages will be present, from children at the age of 10 to adults of 70 and older. The BOM is suited for competitive as well as for recreational runners!<br/>- Secretariat and start are situated at Place Rouppe, at 10min walking distance from the Gare du Midi.<br/>- A comic book figures course is also offered.</p> <p>Here is an info document for people running for the first time with a map.

We all have to start somewhere and work our way up - it only gets better... ;-)</p> <p>FOR THE OTHER RUNNERS (10h15):\u00a0</p> <p>I will split the bunch in 2 groups as there will likely be a variation of runners:</p> <p>(1) for the 8-9 km/h runners (2-3 turns around the park) and;<br/>(2) for the 10-11 km/h runners (2-3 turns around the park)</p> <p>ON THE DAY OF THE RUN</p> <p>(1) We will meet in front of the AUTOWORLD Museum doors (09h45 beginners, 10h15 for the others)<br/>(2) Do a little warm-up;<br/>(3) Run while meeting and chatting with great people;<br/>(4) Little after-run cool-down;<br/>(5) Start off the week on a good note.</p> <p>I usually like to run on Saturdays but my schedule only permits for Sunday this time... Hopefully this doesn't interfere with your other social commitments...</p> <p>Hope to see you in a couple of weeks - lets make this a healthy habit!!!</p>", "created": 1410452737000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "Parc du Cinquantenaire", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.396966, "address_1": "1040", "country": "be", "lat": 50.833233, "id": 15673012}, "updated": 1411914822000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 40, "time": 1411890300000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "206628852", "name": "2.5 or 5 / 7.5 Km - Relaxed and Easy pace - Great for Beginners"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 1, "average": 5}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Brussels-Runners/events/200802382/", "group": {"who": "Runners", "name": "Brussels Runners", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1303718291000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Brussels-Runners", "id": 1820198}, "description": "<p>This seems like a beautiful, flat route alongside the Moselle wine valley, starting and finishing at\u00a0Remich, Luxembourg.

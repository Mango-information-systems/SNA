She prepares a special lunchbox to be delivered to him at work, but, unbeknownst to her, it is mistakenly delivered to another office worker, Saajan, a lonely man on the verge of retirement. Curious about the lack of reaction from her husband, Ila puts a little note in the following day's lunchbox, in the hopes of getting to the bottom of the mystery. This begins a series of lunchbox notes between Saajan and Ila, and the mere comfort of communicating with a stranger anonymously soon evolves into an unexpected friendship. Gradually, their notes become little confessions about their loneliness, memories, regrets, fears, and even small joys. They each discover a new sense of self and find an anchor to hold on to in the big city of Mumbai that so often crushes hopes and dreams. Still strangers physically, Ila and Saajan become lost in a virtual relationship that could jeopardize both their realities.</p>", "created": 1387713434000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "Cin\u00e9ma Vend\u00f4me", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.362947, "address_1": "chauss\u00e9e de Wavre 18", "country": "be", "lat": 50.837475, "id": 16774712}, "updated": 1390222088000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 34, "time": 1390153500000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "156634252", "name": "The Lunch Box"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 2, "average": 4}, "utc_offset": 3600000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Brussels-Film-Fans/events/161090022/", "group": {"who": "Film fans", "name": "Brussels Film Fans", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1368990735000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Brussels-Film-Fans", "id": 8550122}, "description": "<p>As it is quite a late start we can meet before at the \"Le trappiste\" almost next door to the cinema... just down the road... traditional Belgian brasserie...

In their carefully composed cinematic debut, artist duo Jane Pollard and Iain Forsyth combine fiction and reality, private and public and, in one fictional day, capture the life story of this renowned musician. They alternate with documentary footage in rehearsal rooms and recording studios. The narration, unmistakably written and spoken by Cave himself, explains his world view, his life and above all his philosophy when it comes to song writing.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap0_y5EGttk#t=26\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap0_y5EGttk#t=26</a></p> <p>M Hall (downstairs) - tickets 10 euros on <a href=\"http://www.bozar.be/activity.php?id=15486\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.bozar.be/activity.php?id=15486</a></p> <p>18:45 is the time we enter the hall, so be there a few minutes before (with your ticket).</p> <p>I'll be waiting before the entrance of the M hall (so downstairs), I'll be wearing a green coat.</p> <p>We will go for\u00a0a drink afterwards.</p> <p>If you don't come, please do unregister from the event (even last minute, so\u00a0we have\u00a0good idea of the number people we are waiting for)</p> <p>Aur\u00e9lie</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>\u00a0</p>", "created": 1413387577000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "BOZAR Centre for Fine Arts", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.359505, "phone": "02 5078200", "address_1": "23 Rue Ravenstein", "address_2": "1000", "country": "be", "lat": 50.844222, "id": 1477318}, "updated": 1414357581000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 28, "time": 1414345500000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "213593362", "name": "PREMIERE: 20,000 Days on Earth - Nick Cave"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 3600000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Brussels-Film-Fans/events/215392272/", "group": {"who": "Film fans", "name": "Brussels Film Fans", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1368990735000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Brussels-Film-Fans", "id": 8550122}, "description": "<p>So-for anyone not able to join tonight's screening (including myself),there is a chance to see the movie on Monday.Let me know</p>", "created": 1414166462000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "Cinema UGC Toison d'Or", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.360349, "address_1": "avenue de la Toison d'Or 8", "country": "be", "lat": 50.837788, "id": 9679482}, "updated": 1414444854000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 17, "time": 1414432800000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "215392272", "name": "Gone Girl-Monday people"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 3600000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Brussels-Film-Fans/events/214728712/", "group": {"who": "Film fans", "name": "Brussels Film Fans", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1368990735000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Brussels-Film-Fans", "id": 8550122}, "description": "<p>April, 1945.

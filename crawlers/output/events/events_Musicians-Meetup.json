Come connect with other musicians and share your music! It's an exciting time as the group continues to grow.\u00a0</p> <p>****We will be at Novanois again but this time we really need to try and move things back toward the acoustic approach we had in the earlier days of our meetup. The space where we've been meeting at Novanois is really not appropriate for large bands, full drum set, multiple electric guitars, etc... Also, with larger groups, the transitions between each act become quite long.</p> <p>However....we are working with Muriel at Novanois to begin a new additional event in the larger space upstairs for bands and larger groups with a more electric approach. We will be announcing more details very soon!</p> <p>Please continue to come to the acoustic event as well. It is always good to get together. Sometimes it's a fun challenge to present an \"unplugged\" version of something quite edgy.</p> <p>**If you are planning on participating in the \"open mic\" please list your name here. Each artist can share two songs and then if there is more time there will be more opportunities later in the evening.</p> <p>I look forward to seeing you all there.</p> <p><br/>David</p>", "created": 1411208659000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "Novanois", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.377062, "address_1": "Rue des Ailes 3 1030 Schaarbeek", "country": "be", "lat": 50.86742, "id": 13424782}, "updated": 1412427182000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 56, "time": 1412357400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "208399822", "name": "Musician' Meetup Open Mic and Jam Session"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 1, "average": 4}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Musicians-Meetup/events/211966282/", "group": {"who": "Members", "name": "Musician's Meetup", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1344529404000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Musicians-Meetup", "id": 4507502}, "description": "<p>Our meetup at Novanois was fantastic!

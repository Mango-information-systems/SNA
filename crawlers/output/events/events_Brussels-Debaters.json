Being convinced yourself and convincing somebody else is not exactly the same thing!</p> <p>If you recognize this, joining a debating club could be just the thing you need!</p> <p>A debating club offers you both a nice platform and a supportive environment to practice and improve your persuasive skills under the motto \u2018learning by doing\u2019. You try and find out yourself what works and what not, instead of asking consultants or reading books to tell you what to do.</p> <p>Alas, while debating clubs are common in the US, the UK and the Netherlands, <b>the capital of Belgium and the EU doesn\u2019t have one single open debating club</b>!</p> <p>Therefore, I really would like to set up a club in Brussels myself and now I\u2019m looking for interested people who are willing to join. I\u2019m chairman of an existing speech club (toastmasters) and organized workshops on debating before.</p> <p>My wish is to create a club that is <b>democratic</b> in all meanings of the word: it should be open, easy to join, low cost, self-organizing, and last but not least: positive and enjoyable!</p> <p>If you want to keep track of this initiative, than please join it! Once we start the dates will be posted in this Meetup group.</p> <p>For now, I would propose to meet on Monday the 26th of August in The Funkey Monkey to discuss the idea first before organizing the kick-off meeting.</p> <p>FYI I also started a blog <a href=\"http://brusselsdebaters.wordpress.com\">brusselsdebaters.wordpress.com</a> to present and discuss ideas for this club . This is an open blog, so if you've any comments, ideas or reflections related to the issue, please do not hesitate and post them!</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/e/0/6/event_253052262.jpeg\" /></p>", "created": 1372370213000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "The Funky Monkey", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.384015, "address_1": "Rue Archimede 63", "country": "be", "lat": 50.844975, "id": 14255352}, "updated": 1377588563000, "visibility": "public", "how_to_find_us": "The Funky Monkey, Rue Archimede 65, Brussels (nearby Schuman)", "yes_rsvp_count": 21, "time": 1377532800000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "126832682", "name": "Start Brussels Debaters"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 7, "average": 4.570000171661377}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Brussels-Debaters/events/137828212/", "group": {"who": "Debaters", "name": "Brussels Debaters", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1372369092000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Brussels-Debaters", "id": 9121962}, "description": "<p>Dear All,</p> <p>After our first \u2013 very successful - preparatory meeting we're now ready to take off!</p> <p>We\u2019ve arranged a meeting room in the Funkey Hotel (Rue Artan 116) which is at walking distance from Schuman.

We proudly present phase two of Brussels Debaters.</p> <p>From October until Christmas, you have the opportunity to sharpen your debating skills every week. The entire team has spent the summer on designing a curriculum split in three major sections:</p> <p>1. Define your position (2 Oct - 23 Oct)<br/>2. Make your case (30 Oct - 20 Nov)<br/>3. Win the audience (27 Nov - 18 Dec)</p> <p>Each section consists of three interactive training sessions and concludes with a grand debate. The training sessions and sections cover all major aspects - from the anatomy of an argument to debating models and tactics. Everybody can debate at every session. And we strongly recommend that you do because we believe that you cannot learn dancing just by listening to music.</p> <p>The first session is an introductory session. Perfect if you want to get to know debating.</p> <p>When and where do we meet up?<br/>Thursdays, from 18:30 to 21:00 at the Hogeschool-Universiteit Brussel (HUB) next to Gare Central. When you enter the main entrance, you will find signs guiding you to the room 3402 on the third floor.<br/>You are more than welcome to bring interested friends along.</p> <p>We are looking forward to hearing you!</p> <p>Adam, Ben, Jonas, Lieven, Meriem, Pascal<br/>Brussels Debaters Team</p>", "created": 1410985569000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "HUB", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.35644, "address_1": "Warmoesberg 26", "country": "be", "lat": 50.848949, "id": 18939352}, "updated": 1411886299000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 20, "time": 1411662600000, "duration": 9000000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "207871262", "name": "Introductory session and kick-off"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 1, "average": 5}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Brussels-Debaters/events/209526142/", "group": {"who": "Debaters", "name": "Brussels Debaters", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1372369092000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Brussels-Debaters", "id": 9121962}, "description": "<p>Often you look at the title of a debate but everybody seems to talk about something completely different.

What caused the collapse of Vlaams Belang? Has N-VA reached its peak now?) and forward to the formation of government (will N-VA be part of the government? Will we have a christiandemocrats-liberals coalition, or will we see the classical three party coalition socialists-liberals-christiandemocrats without N-VA and Groen? Who will become prime minister? What should be the primary tasks to work on once the new government is installed?)</p> <p>I realise political debates are sometimes a bit sensitive or heated, but then I also believe we're all adults who know how to behave and who know how to exchange opinions, even when those opinions vary a lot. I think trusting the members is important, and that thus political debates should be given a chance. We don't want to assume people would start screaming or insulting each other for having varying opinions ; I do think we're all mature people who can deal with different opinions in a polite and tolerant manner.</p>", "created": 1401897064000, "rsvp_limit": 1, "updated": 1413064453000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 3, "time": 1413061200000, "duration": 2700000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "187109292", "name": "Political post-election debate"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 3, "average": 5}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Brussels-Debaters/events/211253022/", "group": {"who": "Debaters", "name": "Brussels Debaters", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1372369092000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Brussels-Debaters", "id": 9121962}, "description": "<p>Have you ever performed a speech and faced puzzled looks?

Have you ever danced just for the pleasure of dancing? Have you ever danced not bothering who is watching or who is not watching or if your moves are trendy? Have you ever danced with all your being, free without the help of substances such as alcohol? Have you ever danced meditatively and reach extasis? Have you ever danced in stillness?</p> <p>If not this is your chance to do it!</p> <p>In ancient times people learned to dance around fire and make their first journeys in to the worlds of spirits and the subtle worlds of energy. Together with this they discovered empowerment, inspiration and true joy! After having done these techniques people find immense wisdom and inspiration that arises from within connecting them to their higher selves and eternal consciousness. Come to learn about what it is to dance for the spirit and engage in entering your being with your dancing expression! In these 3 hours we will dance non stop, listening to modern music, we will let our bodies be expressed and release stress and anxiety without judgments, we will learn better our bodies and connect with them in a deeper level, we will be joyful and creative! Bring also your friends!</p> <p>If you need to feel free this is the night for you! We will be expecting you all with love!</p> <p>Please arrive 10 minutes before the event begins.

This Full Moon in some shamanic tribes is called the Hunter's Moon because from this period started the hunting. It also signifies the period for setting targets, putting goals and start your \"hunting period\" in every endeavor in your life!<br/>Come and join us to receive healing and information about your future, connect with shamanic spirits for health, empowerment, better relationships and abundance in this ceremony that will last approx. 2 hours.<br/>This Full Moon though is more important and for another reason. There is also a total eclipse of the moon that is happening the same day (in Brussels is happening around noon of Oct 8)<br/>The total eclipse represents a time where the portal of the subconscious will be \"locked\" for a while and people will have a chance to look deeper in to the reasons of their beliefs and inspirations or sufferings. You can have a chance to make deep changes in your life at this time (if you are ready and willing). So join us for a deep spiritual transformational shamanic ritual with the drum and the tarot cards!</p> <p>Participation cost 20 euro - For the intention<br/>Bring with you warm clothes and flash light!</p> <p>See you soon!!

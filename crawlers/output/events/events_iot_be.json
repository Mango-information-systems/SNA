Overarching automation logic is hardly possible in those setups - this is not really smart.\u00a0</p> <p><br/>The openHAB project seeks to overcome the challenges of interoperability and introduces a highly flexible architecture perfectly tailored to the needs of developers. This talk gives an overview of the things that are relevant in a Smart Home and shows how openHAB allows the creation of a personal Intranet of Things.

With SmartLiving we want to give consumers the possibility to create their own Internet of Things which transcends existing home automation systems.</p> <p>Traditional home automation systems are known to be closed, expensive, require to \u2018rewire\u2019 your home and are already \u2018outdated\u2019 the moment you install them.</p> <p>SmartLiving is based on a SCALABLE and OPEN platform allow you to connect the devices you already own, such as you SmartPhone, devices you make yourself as a hobby and smart devices you already can buy, with the online services you love.</p> <p>The project targets as well the makers and developers as the early majority communities and tries to bring them together. Where makers can contribute in creating solutions which are required by the crowd, developers contribute and benefit from delivering the killer apps which users are waiting for.\u00a0 Our goal is to create an ecosystem around the personal Internet of Things.</p> <p>SmartLiving\u2019s mantra?

If \"Big Data\" is the product of the IOT, \"Data Science\" is it's soul.\u00a0</p> <p>Let's define our terms:</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Internet of Things (IOT): equipping all physical and organic things in the world with identifying intelligent devices allowing the near real-time collecting and sharing of data between machines and humans. The IOT era has already begun, albeit in it's first primitive stage.</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Data Science: the analysis of data creation. May involve machine learning, algorithm design, computer science, modeling, statistics, analytics, math, artificial intelligence and business strategy.</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Big Data: the collection, storage, analysis and distribution/access of large data sets. Usually includes data sets with sizes beyond the ability of standard software tools to capture, curate, manage, and process the data within a tolerable elapsed time.</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0We are in the pre-industrial age of data technology and science used to process and understand data. Yet the early evidence provides hope that we can manage and extract knowledge and wisdom from this data to improve life, business and public services at many levels.</p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/e/4/2/600_427792802.jpeg\" /></p>", "created": 1411412155000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "VUB - Aula QB", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.392154, "address_1": "Pleinlaan 2B - 1050", "country": "be", "lat": 50.8232, "id": 22978702}, "updated": 1415380528000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 86, "time": 1416331800000, "duration": 10800000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "208815012", "name": "Data Science and the Internet of Things"}, {"status": "upcoming", "utc_offset": 3600000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/iot_be/events/214921872/", "group": {"who": "Smart People", "name": "IoTBE - the Belgian Internet of Things community", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1371168181000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "iot_be", "id": 8919372}, "description": "<p><b>Agenda:\u00a0</b></p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<b>Gatewing/Trimble</b> designs and manufactures industry-leading <i>UAS/drones</i> for surveying and mapping.\u00a0</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<b>dotOcean</b> provides innovative <i>underwater instruments and sensor networks</i> which significantly enhance the processes of our customers.</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<b>ivips</b>\u00a0brings innovation and automation for fleet managers and their businesses through their <i>smart car solution</i>.</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0<b>Prodata Mobility Systems N.V.</b> connecting mobile devices with the public transport by giving answers to questions like \"Can mobile devices ease the use of public transport?\" and \"What is the shortest path between the mobile device and the vehicle?\"</p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/6/3/8/600_322062552.jpeg\" /></p>", "created": 1413955719000, "venue": {"city": "9050 Ledeberg", "name": "iMinds", "repinned": false, "lon": 3.735754, "address_1": "Gaston Crommenlaan 10", "country": "be", "lat": 51.03606, "id": 13329762}, "updated": 1415180621000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 39, "time": 1418320800000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "214921872", "name": "Belgian IoT Solutions - On land, at sea and in the air"}]

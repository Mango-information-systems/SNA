There are however a lot of extra concerns that come into play when you try to leverage AngularJS for building a full enterprise application.</p> <p><br/>In this AngularJS Meetup we\u2019ll build an AngularJS enterprise application step by step using a bottom up approach. With our experience building AngularJS enterprise applications we\u2019ll show you how to avoid some common caveats. We\u2019ll show our best practices to:\u00a0</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Handle i18n localization for your website.</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Create a Grunt workflow for continuous delivery.</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0How to tackle different environments (dev, test, ac) in an efficient and secure way by leveraging middleware.</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0How to leverage generators for common patterns.</p> <p>From our experience building AngularJS applications for customers, we will show you how to avoid some of the common mistakes. This will be more an interactive session where you can try out the different steps for building the application.</p> <p>This session is kindly hosted by the people of Dataflow at the business lounge of the OHL soccer team in Leuven (Heverlee).</p> <p><b>Speakers</b></p> <p><b>Daan Kets</b></p> <p>Daan Kets (Blackbit Consulting, Delta Source) is a flemish independent enterprise IT architect , and currently active as a member of the bpost IT architecture team.

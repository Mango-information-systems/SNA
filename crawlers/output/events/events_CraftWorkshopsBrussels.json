During these workshops, you will learn how to crochet a chain, a double crochet and depending how fast you pick up, also a half double crochet and the granny square stitch. During this class you will pick the colors and (if needed) the crochet needle you want.</p> <p><br/><b>Class 2 - 7</b>: Classes are there to ask questions, learn new stitches and work on your blanket.</p> <p><br/>After these classes, you should be able to continue the pattern by yourself as the pattern repeats stiches you have already done.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Time &amp; location</b></p> <p>Each workshop is from 19:00 - 22:00 and is at my place.

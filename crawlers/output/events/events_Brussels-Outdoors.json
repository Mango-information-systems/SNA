On the way back we will make a stop in the forest to eat, rest and smell the flowers, and then come back to Brussels happy and satisfied :)</p> <p>The ride to Overijse takes about 1h20\u201d at a leisurely pace. The path is asphalted/paved all the way, even in the forest, so you can come on a city- or race bike.</p> <p>The wine tasting is free, with over 40 winemakers from different regions present. You can check out the list of wines <a href=\"http://www.dewitwines.be/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/wine-tasting-dewit-april-2014_b.pdf\">here</a>.\u00a0They have some promotions going on with this occasion, so bring a backpack if you think you may want to buy. Disclosure: I have no connection to the company, I just heard about the tasting and called them for info.</p> <p>After the tasting we will return to the forest where we will stop in a scenic spot at around 1pm to eat and relax for a bit, enjoying the crisp fresh air and beautiful surroundings. We will head back to Brussels at around 2-2:30pm.</p> <p>\n\n\nA few things to note:</p> <p>- \u00a0Please taste responsibly. Riding under the influence is illegal and you can lose your driving license. Also, I would like everybody to get home in better shape and higher mood than when we left :)</p> <p>- \u00a0Do bring sandwiches, fruit or whatever you would like to eat when we stop. There are no restaurants and shops in the forest.</p> <p>- \u00a0The weather forecast is not great but we have been tremendously lucky in the past so let\u2019s keep our collective fingers crossed for this Sunday :) I will post updates here until 1h before the meetup so please check back here before you leave the house.</p> <p>-\u00a0 You can always leave me a message if you have any questions.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/f/b/a/600_355268122.jpeg\" /></p>", "created": 1398374554000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "Merode roundabout", "repinned": false, "lon": 0, "address_1": "Entrance of Park Cinquantennaire", "country": "be", "lat": 0, "id": 19736712}, "updated": 1398649721000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 3, "time": 1398587400000, "duration": 18000000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "179080092", "name": "Bike Ride & Wine Tasting"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 4, "average": 5}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Brussels-Outdoors/events/180861962/", "group": {"who": "Members", "name": "Brussels Outdoors", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1394530823000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Brussels-Outdoors", "id": 13280192}, "description": "<p>Hello everyone!

The route\u00a0is pretty easy, even with a Villo bike, but do not be mistaken, your endurance and balance will be challenged!\u00a0Some stops are forseen along the way.\u00a0There are music trucks - how fun! - and sometimes even freebies handed by sponsors.</p> <p>We meet at 19:45 at the\u00a0main entrance of \u00c9glise Notre-Dame du Sablon. We will move to Place Poelaert at 19:55 to ride with the main group, coming back to the same place at 11:45pm.</p> <p>\n\n\nSome pictures of last Friday:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Brussels-Outdoors/photos/all_photos/?photoAlbumId=24735112\"><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Brussels-Outdoors/photos/all_photos/?photoAlbumId=24735112\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/Brussels-Outdoors/photos/all_photos/?photoAlbumId=24735112</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\nSample video:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjy2AIoxFIA\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjy2AIoxFIA</a></p> <p>\n\n\nMore info:\u00a0<a href=\"http://belgiumrollers.com/en/\"><a href=\"http://belgiumrollers.com/en/\" class=\"linkified\">http://belgiumrollers.com/en/</a></a></p>", "created": 1411651453000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "\u00c9glise Notre-Dame du Sablon", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.35545, "address_1": "Place du Grand Sablon", "country": "be", "lat": 50.84079, "id": 22421472}, "updated": 1411843221000, "visibility": "public", "how_to_find_us": "Main entrance (with the stairs) of \u00c9glise Notre-Dame du Sablon", "yes_rsvp_count": 4, "time": 1411753500000, "duration": 14400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 4, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "209433012", "name": "Last Roller-Bike Parade of 2014"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 2, "average": 5}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Brussels-Outdoors/events/209742692/", "group": {"who": "Members", "name": "Brussels Outdoors", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1394530823000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Brussels-Outdoors", "id": 13280192}, "description": "<p>Hello everyone :)</p> <p>Let's cycle through the beautiful autumn colors in Forest de Soignes this Sunday!\u00a0</p> <p>We depart from\u00a0the church of Notre-Dame du Sablon\u00a0at 10am, going towards Merode and then cycle through Foret de Soignes to Jezus-Eik and back, around 25km in total.\u00a0The bike path is asphalted/paved all the way, even in the forest, so you can come on a city- or race bike.\u00a0We can stop to rest and refresh at a cafe in\u00a0Jezus-Eik before heading back.\u00a0</p> <p>You can check out the route on\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.google.be/maps/dir/Notre-Dame+du+Sablon,+1000+Brussels/Jezus-Eik/@50.8199766,4.4094175,13z/data=!4m34!4m33!1m25!1m1!1s0x47c3c47d22596345:0xec939b5c796591c6!2m2!1d4.356207!2d50.840318!3m4!1m2!1d4.363424!2d50.844164!3s0x47c3c4817075bbbd:0x84a6ff687601f4c6!3m4!1m2!1d4.3858457!2d50.8400274!3s0x47c3c4a3b5ff013f:0x1bae4a3c5f180ce5!3m4!1m2!1d4.3924573!2d50.8382446!3s0x47c3c4a4fe35d1a5:0x60d796fc7d969ab9!3m4!1m2!1d4.3979044!2d50.8395869!3s0x47c3c4af1f93e7f9:0x961582a8cf8a48a2!1m5!1m1!1s0x47c3d989e9ea9ef1:0x3cf2942a1e54ac05!2m2!1d4.48962!2d50.793!3e1?hl=en\">Google maps</a>.</p> <p>Here's a picture of the forest from this spring:</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/f/b/a/600_355268122.jpeg\" /></p>", "created": 1411767029000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "\u00c9glise Notre-Dame du Sablon", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.35545, "address_1": "Place du Grand Sablon", "country": "be", "lat": 50.84079, "id": 22421472}, "updated": 1411918752000, "visibility": "public", "how_to_find_us": "Main entrance of \u00c9glise Notre-Dame du Sablon (with the stairs)", "yes_rsvp_count": 7, "time": 1411891200000, "duration": 12600000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 7, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "209742692", "name": "Bike Ride in Foret de Soignes"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Brussels-Outdoors/events/215393822/", "group": {"who": "Members", "name": "Brussels Outdoors", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1394530823000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Brussels-Outdoors", "id": 13280192}, "description": "<p>Hello everyone :)</p> <p>Let's see the beautiful autumn colors in Forest de Soignes and Bois de la Cambre this Saturday!\u00a0</p> <p>We depart from\u00a0the church of Notre-Dame du Sablon\u00a0at 9:30am.

This is a sandbox style game set in\u00a0the Golden Age of Piracy. You choose to seek glory as a pirate or a merchant - or why not a bit of both! Seek your fortune through trade, rumor hunting, missions, and of course, plundering. Modify your ship, buy impressive vessels, load deadly special ammunition, and hire specialist crew members. Players will have to fight of NPC pirates, pirate hunter naval vessels as well as each other.</p> <p>Please note that this is a longer game (up to 180 minutes). It would be great if all players make sure to be available from 19:30 to head out to sea as quickly as possible.\u00a0</p> <p>\n\n\n<b>LOCATION</b></p> <p>Depending on the days, the session will be at <b>La Table Food &amp; Games</b>.

You get three actions a turn to buy cards which then let you lay tiles to control land and herds, or you may buy extras, such as waterholes or the haciendas of the title to get bonus points.</p> <p>The game has two card decks, one showing the different land types on the hex map, the other the different animals (pigs, cows, horses and sheep). Some cards are laid face up and you pay 3 pesos to buy the ones you want, or 2 pesos for an unknown card from the draw deck. You spend the cards to put your markers on land and to place your animal tokens on the board. Animals of a type go together to make a herd naturally, and each time a herd touches a market town on the board, you earn money for the size of herd and land attached. With careful hand and herd management, you can make good cash gains and also block your opponents. You need the money to buy more cards of course. 12 pesos also buys waterholes you can place next to your herds, or haciendas to go on your land or herds. If you run short of money, you can call a harvest and get cash off your land.</p> <p>But the game is not about money. You score victory points halfway through the game and at the end. The more markets you are serving, the more points you get. The herds and the land get you points. The water and haciendas get you bonus points as well, which can be crucial to your success.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/6/4/8/600_360878472.jpeg\" /></p> <p>LOCATION</p> <p>The session will be at La Table Food &amp; Games.

Employ the most suitable teams of builders and make sure that you always have enough of the right currency.

A game is typically played to 8 or 10 victory points, which may be accrued through winning attacks, controlling temples, controlling fully-developed pyramids, sacrificing to the gods, and wielding particular magical powers.</p> <p>The conquest for the land of Kemet takes place over two phases: Day and Night. During the day, choose an action amongst the nine possible choices provided by your player mat and perform it immediately. Once every player has taken five actions, night falls, with players gathering Prayer Points from their temples, drawing Divine Intervention cards, and determining the turn order before the start of the new day.</p> <p>As the game progresses, they can use Prayer Points to acquire power tiles. Some of these enroll magical creatures and have them join their troops. In addition to intimidating enemies, these creatures provide special powers!</p> <p>Detailed miniature components represent the combat units and the supernatural creatures that are summoned to enhance them. Combat is resolved through cards chosen from a diminishing six-card hand and enhanced by bonuses.</p> <p><br/>LOCATION</p> <p>The session will be at La Table Food &amp; Games.

This is a sandbox style game set in\u00a0the Golden Age of Piracy. You choose to seek glory as a pirate or a merchant - or why not a bit of both! Seek your fortune through trade, rumor hunting, missions, and of course, plundering. Modify your ship, buy impressive vessels, load deadly special ammunition, and hire specialist crew members. Players will have to fight of NPC pirates, pirate hunter naval vessels as well as each other.</p> <p>Please note that this is a longer game (up to 180 minutes but with a swift introduction close to 120 minutes is certainly very feasible).</p> <p>\n\n\nThis is the second instalment of Merchants and Marauders on the Monkey scene.

Gather resources, develop commercial routes, and affirm your military supremacy. Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.</p> <p><br/>7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.</p> <p><br/>In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how his choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/8/e/e/600_395027342.jpeg\" /></p>", "created": 1407226930000, "rsvp_limit": 14, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "La Table Food & Games", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.365352, "address_1": "63 rue de l'enseignement, 1000", "country": "be", "lat": 50.848831, "id": 15583872}, "updated": 1407443049000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 11, "time": 1407430800000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "199094532", "name": "Afterwork Session: 7 Wonders"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Boardgame-Monkeys-Brussels/events/199087872/", "group": {"who": "Monkeys", "name": "Boardgame Monkeys Brussels", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1371725010000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Boardgame-Monkeys-Brussels", "id": 9011652}, "description": "<p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/0/9/e/600_337036542.jpeg\" /> <img src=\"http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1724653_md.jpg\" /></p> <p><a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/137297/augustus\"><a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/137297/augustus\" class=\"linkified\">http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/137297/augustus</a></a></p> <p>In Augustus, you vie with your fellow players to complete \"objective\" cards for special powers and ultimately for victory points.

There are 2 teams, the <b>Red Team</b> and the <b>Blue Team</b>. The Blue Team has a <i>President</i>. The Red Team has a <i>Bomber</i>.</p> <p>Each room has a\u00a0<b>leader</b>\u00a0selected by the players in that room. The leader chooses\u00a0<b>hostages</b>\u00a0(players who will be sent into the other room at the end of the round).\u00a0</p> <p>The game consists of 3 <b>timed rounds</b>. Each round is shorter than the previous round. At the end of each round,\u00a0 the hostages selected by the leaders will be traded into opposing rooms. If the Red Team\u2019s Bomber is in the <b>same room</b> as the President at the end of the game, then the Red Team wins. Otherwise the Blue Team wins.</p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http://www.brusselsgamesfestival.be/website/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/BGF-2014-WEB-FR-site.jpg\" /></p>", "created": 1403592993000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "La Table Food & Games", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.365352, "address_1": "63 rue de l'enseignement, 1000", "country": "be", "lat": 50.848831, "id": 15583872}, "updated": 1408226953000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 20, "time": 1408176000000, "duration": 49500000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "190914292", "name": "Brussels Games Festival - DAY 02: Fair & Tournaments"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Boardgame-Monkeys-Brussels/events/197485572/", "group": {"who": "Monkeys", "name": "Boardgame Monkeys Brussels", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1371725010000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Boardgame-Monkeys-Brussels", "id": 9011652}, "description": "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.brusselsgamesfestival.be/website/\">Brussels Games Festival</a> has it's 2nd edition <b>15 - 16 - 17 AUGUST</b>.\u00a0 The program for Sunday:</p> <p>\n\n<b>Tournaments:</b></p> <p>\u2022 12h00 \u2013 17h00 Seasons</p> <p>\u2022 12h00 \u2013 17h00 Krosmaster Arena</p> <p>\u2022\u00a012h30 \u2013 16h30 Splendor</p> <p>\u2022\u00a012h30 \u2013 17h30 7 Wonders (base game)</p> <p>\u2022\u00a013h30 \u2013 17h30 Le Petit Prince</p> <p>\u2022\u00a012h30 \u2013 16h30 Time Masters <b><br/></b></p> <p><i>Registration required</i>: <a href=\"http://www.brusselsgamesfestival.be/website/tournois-2014/\"><a href=\"http://www.brusselsgamesfestival.be/website/tournois-2014/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.brusselsgamesfestival.be/website/tournois-2014/</a></a></p> <p><br/><i>Participation fee is 3\u20ac per tournament</i> - there will be prizes for the winners (podium) offered/sponsored by Asmodee.</p> <p>\n\n\n<i>Prices for the tournaments:</i></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/e/2/4/600_394571812.jpeg\" /></p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>Fair Activities:</b></p> <p><br/>To be confirmed next week.</p> <p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img src=\"http://www.brusselsgamesfestival.be/website/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/BGF-2014-WEB-FR-site.jpg\" /></p>", "created": 1406545563000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "La Table Food & Games", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.365352, "address_1": "63 rue de l'enseignement, 1000", "country": "be", "lat": 50.848831, "id": 15583872}, "updated": 1408292706000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 6, "time": 1408262400000, "duration": 28800000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "197485572", "name": "Brussels Games Festival - DAY 03: Fair & Tournaments"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Boardgame-Monkeys-Brussels/events/202874792/", "group": {"who": "Monkeys", "name": "Boardgame Monkeys Brussels", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1371725010000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Boardgame-Monkeys-Brussels", "id": 9011652}, "description": "<p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/0/9/e/600_337036542.jpeg\" /> <img src=\"http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic544780.jpg\" /></p> <p>\n\n\n<a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/53953/thunderstone\" class=\"linkified\">http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/53953/thunderstone</a></p> <p><br/>Thunderstone is a fantasy deck-building game much in the style of Dominion. Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomnly chosen that players may add to their specific decks. Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards. In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon.</p> <p>A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters together. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types so players will have to take this into account when they choose what to buy.</p> <p>Rather than buying puny Victory Points, player's will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. Players may on their turn choose to attack a monster in the deck rather than visit town and buy cards. If they do this they play cards from their hand and resolve their abilities in order to boost strength and have enough light to reach a specific monster. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards. In addition to this players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions. The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it. The player with the most victory points in their deck is the winner.</p>", "created": 1408904073000, "rsvp_limit": 5, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "La Table Food & Games", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.365352, "address_1": "63 rue de l'enseignement, 1000", "country": "be", "lat": 50.848831, "id": 15583872}, "updated": 1409256282000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 5, "time": 1409245200000, "waitlist_count": 1, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "202874792", "name": "Afterwork Session: Thunderstone"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Boardgame-Monkeys-Brussels/events/206127592/", "group": {"who": "Monkeys", "name": "Boardgame Monkeys Brussels", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1371725010000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Boardgame-Monkeys-Brussels", "id": 9011652}, "description": "<p>Kingdom builder big box, special kickstarter edition ;)</p> <p>Will probably limit the components I'll bring with me cause I'll come straight from work and I don't want to carry around the huge big box (also quite heavy)!</p> <p>I'll try to bring along an expansion at least</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1016374822/kingdom-builder-big-box-kickstarter-edition\"><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1016374822/kingdom-builder-big-box-kickstarter-edition\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1016374822/kingdom-builder-big-box-kickstarter-edition</a></a></p>", "created": 1410248885000, "rsvp_limit": 5, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "La Table Food & Games", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.365352, "address_1": "63 rue de l'enseignement, 1000", "country": "be", "lat": 50.848831, "id": 15583872}, "updated": 1410471481000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 5, "time": 1410458400000, "duration": 10800000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "206127592", "name": "Kingdom builder"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Boardgame-Monkeys-Brussels/events/203682512/", "group": {"who": "Monkeys", "name": "Boardgame Monkeys Brussels", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1371725010000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Boardgame-Monkeys-Brussels", "id": 9011652}, "description": "<p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/0/9/e/600_337036542.jpeg\" /></p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/5/8/6/600_402313702.jpeg\" /></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/42776/gears-war-board-game\"><a href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/42776/gears-war-board-game\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/42776/gears-war-board-game</a></a></p> <p><br/><i><br/></i></p> <p>This is a purely combat-oriented game, so may not appeal to everyone. There is no need to know (or like) the video game it is based on, to enjoy this.\u00a0</p> <p>\n\n\nFrom BGG:</p> <p><br/><i>For a time, the humans of Sera knew peace...then Emergence Day came. The Locust horde arrived without warning, and countless horrors spilled forth from their underground burrows. The Coalition of Organized Governments (COG) struggled to fend off the subterranean threat, but their defenses were quickly crushed. With billions dead, humans turned their weapons of mass destruction on their own cities to deny the enemy control. Now the long struggle against overwhelming odds approaches one final, desperate stand.</i></p> <p><br/>Gears of War: The Board Game, designed by Corey Konieczka, is based on the wildly popular third-person shooter by Epic Games. One to four players take on the roles of COG soldiers cooperating to destroy the Locust horde, and must work together to complete missions against an ingeniously challenging and varied game system. In\u00a0Gears of War: The Board Game, you\u2019ll relive classic moments from\u00a0Gears of War\u00a0and\u00a0Gears of War 2\u00a0\u2013 Roadie Run into cover, spray your enemy with blind fire, or rip him in half with your Lancer's chainsaw!</p> <p>In\u00a0Gears of War: The Board Game\u00a0you must fulfill one of seven randomly constructed missions and support your fellow COGs as your team engages an unflinching enemy in furious, white-knuckle firefights! Only through teamwork and communication will you gain a tactical advantage, completing your mission and striking a blow for humanity.</p> <p>You'll need every soldier you can get if you hope to send the Locust horde back to their holes. Leave no man behind!</p> <p>\n\n\n<img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/a/0/4/600_402314852.jpeg\" /></p>", "created": 1409232055000, "rsvp_limit": 4, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "La Table Food & Games", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.365352, "address_1": "63 rue de l'enseignement, 1000", "country": "be", "lat": 50.848831, "id": 15583872}, "updated": 1410555263000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 4, "time": 1410543000000, "waitlist_count": 3, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "203682512", "name": "Afterwork Session: Gears of War"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 3, "average": 4.670000076293945}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Boardgame-Monkeys-Brussels/events/204403472/", "group": {"who": "Monkeys", "name": "Boardgame Monkeys Brussels", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1371725010000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Boardgame-Monkeys-Brussels", "id": 9011652}, "description": "<p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/8/b/a/600_404695482.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>BrusselSprouts</b> is an active boardgaming group on <a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/guild/1502\">Boardgamegeek</a>.

In case there are takers for something different next to the eurogame genreHeroes of Normandie is a light wargame with a Hollywood twist: heroics before hyperrealism. It is fun as a combat game. The emphasis is on fast, cinematic action of good GIs versus bad Nazis in the style of a big budget Hollywood production. Be prepared to need some rules in mind for making tactical decisions but the game does a great job of not getting bogged down with too much detail. I'll be able to quickly explain what your guys can and cannot do.\u00a0</p> <p>There are multiplayer rules up to 4 players, so my goal is to try for a 2 v. 2. Our game would take about 2 hours plus a half an hour of explanation.\u00a0</p> <p>\n\n\nNote: I'm assuming La Table is open for business this week.

Extreme weather with frequent and\u00a0 deadly storms, exposed, steep, tricky routes and lack of oxygen await you on your way to the summit. You will test your climbing skills to death, try to outsmart the ever-changing weather and always worry about the acclimatization of your 2 mountaineers. Also there are the other teams ready to take the glory for themselves.</p> <p>K2 is a board game in which each player controls a team of 2 mountaineers, trying to climb to the summit of K2 and return before the other players' teams and before the mountain kills them. Every player uses an identical deck of cards. You use the cards to move your climbers on the route pictured on the gaming board, or to acclimatize the members of your team.\u00a0<br/>You can also set up a tent and wait for better weather. You will have to choose your path carefully, as the other mountaineers can block your way, and watch the upcoming weather which can lower your acclimatization to 0, thus killing your climbers.</p> <p>K2 is a hand management game for 1-5 players, with strong interaction and low luck factor, lasting up to 60 minutes. The theme is very well represented by the mechanics, including such elements as changing weather, lack of oxygen and death of the mountaineers. The result is an exciting match for gamers and non-gamers alike.</p> <p>The box includes, among other materials, a double-sided board with two different routes to the summit (easier and harder) and two sets of weather tiles (for summer and winter).</p>", "created": 1411392732000, "rsvp_limit": 5, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "La Table Food & Games", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.365352, "address_1": "63 rue de l'enseignement, 1000", "country": "be", "lat": 50.848831, "id": 15583872}, "updated": 1411679265000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 5, "time": 1411666200000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "208736772", "name": "Afterwork Session: K2"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Boardgame-Monkeys-Brussels/events/209238472/", "group": {"who": "Monkeys", "name": "Boardgame Monkeys Brussels", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1371725010000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Boardgame-Monkeys-Brussels", "id": 9011652}, "description": "<p>I will play K2 myself but do not hesitate to show up anyway and grab whatever game you like.

This is a re-release of <a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173/formula-de\">Formula D\u00e9</a> with several changes from the original format. Whilst old tracks can be used with the updated Formula D rules, the new game features boards that have an F1 track and a Street Track on the other side. These street tracks each have a novel inclusion or two to add greater theme -</p> <p>The game mechanisms are a simple race, get to the finish line first! However, players have to use a significant amount of planning, and rely on quite a bit of luck. Each player manages when to shift gears, with each gear providing a different speed. (For example, 4th gear is a die that rolls random numbers from 7 to 12 for spaces moved.) Each turn, players may move up one gear, stay in that gear, or move down gears. This forces players to match possible rolls with the optimum distance for that turn, and hopefully plan ahead. However, speed is not the only issue! Corners have a \"stop\" rule that requires players to stop once, twice, or three times on that corner in consecutive turns or face a penalty. This creates an effective speed limit to the corners.</p> <p>Of course, things do not always go as planned! Players take penalties if they miss their roll, bump into another car, are blocked by other cars, have to brake heavily, or have to downshift several gears. These are taken off of a car\u2019s attributes (Tire health, Brake wear, Transmission Gears, Body, engine, and Suspension). Losing the maximum in any of these categories will result in elimination, or a severe setback for that car. This requires that players manage their car\u2019s health, plan for their best path, and have good luck on their rolls. This high amount of luck gives the game its family appeal, and lets weaker players have a chance at winning once in a while.</p>", "created": 1413042364000, "rsvp_limit": 6, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "La Table Food & Games", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.365352, "address_1": "63 rue de l'enseignement, 1000", "country": "be", "lat": 50.848831, "id": 15583872}, "updated": 1413494004000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 5, "time": 1413480600000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "212812052", "name": "Afterwork Session: Formula D"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 2, "average": 4.5}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Boardgame-Monkeys-Brussels/events/214403522/", "group": {"who": "Monkeys", "name": "Boardgame Monkeys Brussels", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1371725010000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Boardgame-Monkeys-Brussels", "id": 9011652}, "description": "<p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/9/4/600_412784692.jpeg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1362404_md.jpg\" /></p> <p>It's your lifelong dream \u2013 to join the Star Patrol and be part of the crew of an interstellar Starship.

In the late 18th Century, the Shawnee and Iroquois Indians pointed white Desperadoes, Mercenaries and Adventurers in the direction of hidden caches of valuable jewels, in the hopes of turning them against one another and away from their territorial expansion ambitions. Players play as some of those Adventurers.</p> <p><br/>The first player to be able to claim ownership of five jewels is the winner. But the chase after the riches has some snags. The speed of the river is always changing, since the speed depends on the decisions of the players and the changeable weather.

In the game, which is played out on a scrolling space backdrop, the players take on the roles of brave space pilots sweeping around in nimble yet powerful fighters, searching the asteroid clusters for universal glory and ancient technology. Players compete to obtain the most glory, with glory resulting from carrying out missions, finding lost treasure in asteroid clusters, and destroying alien entities, not to mention other players.</p> <p>In the game, players fly through an ever-scrolling space setting, which is represented by rows of cards. Each turn, the bottom row is removed and a new row is added to the top. Players move their spaceships and resolve effects continuously, performing actions such as collecting power-ups and money, fighting alien cruisers and titans, blocking and shooting other players, and dodging asteroids and black holes. The players need to balance the use of their ships' energy as it's used for both absorbing enemy fire and boosting their movement speed and fire rate.</p> <p>The game includes missions and achievements as well as a mechanism called \"threat level\" to keep everyone in suspense throughout the whole game. Threat allows players to enjoy the satisfaction of both shooting wildly at each other and dodging the hundreds of bullets raining down from enemy fighters and other players.</p> <p>All player ships are fully upgradeable with four different weapon classes, engines, shields and more. Each player must buy the upgrades and navigate the path that best fits his chosen strategy in order to successfully complete his missions and attain the most glory.</p> <p><br/><a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/154301/battle-kembles-cascade\" class=\"linkified\">http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/154301/battle-kembles-cascade</a></p>", "created": 1413837788000, "rsvp_limit": 4, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "La Table Food & Games", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.365352, "address_1": "63 rue de l'enseignement, 1000", "country": "be", "lat": 50.848831, "id": 15583872}, "updated": 1414183206000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 3, "time": 1414171800000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "214628632", "name": "Afterwork Session: The Battle at Kemble's Cascade"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 2, "average": 4.5}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Boardgame-Monkeys-Brussels/events/214550532/", "group": {"who": "Monkeys", "name": "Boardgame Monkeys Brussels", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1371725010000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Boardgame-Monkeys-Brussels", "id": 9011652}, "description": "<p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/9/4/600_412784692.jpeg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/7/3/c/600_423742332.jpeg\" /></p> <p>BGG:\u00a0<a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/139033/archon-glory-machination\"><a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/139033/archon-glory-machination\" class=\"linkified\">http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/139033/archon-glory-machination</a></a></p> <p>\n\n\nThe land of Cardis has been ruled for many years by King Rhodrig. Cardis is a rich and powerful kingdom controlling all neighboring provinces, which provide valuable resources. All this wealth attracts warlords and raiding parties who more than often launch attacks against the kingdom. So far Cardis has stood against such attacks but with heavy casualties. Thanks to the support of wealthy Archons, the kingdom gets rebuilt so that Science and Arts can flourish once again. At the same time new soldiers are recruited and the army prepares for the inevitable moment when the kingdom will need to be defended once again.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/9/3/a/600_423742842.jpeg\" /> In\u00a0Archon: Glory &amp; Machination, players are powerful Archons who support Cardis in order to win King's favor. Players use their inf</p> <p>luence on their Courtiers and on various figures of authority (Magisters).</p> <p>Each game consists of three Seasons. For each of these Seasons, the King issues different demands that players must fulfill in order to score Victory Points. Each season consists of 3 rounds during which players use a card-driven worker placement mechanism to perform various actions that will allow them to gather resources and income, recruit soldiers and, rebuild the city, and acquire scoring cards (Science &amp; Arts). They will also have the chance to train Elite Warriors to assist in the city's defense. After nine rounds, the game ends and the player with the most Victory Points wins.</p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/a/f/2/600_423743282.jpeg\" /></p>", "created": 1413816871000, "rsvp_limit": 4, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "La Table Food & Games", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.365352, "address_1": "63 rue de l'enseignement, 1000", "country": "be", "lat": 50.848831, "id": 15583872}, "updated": 1414223948000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 4, "time": 1414171800000, "waitlist_count": 1, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "214550532", "name": "Afterwork Session: Archon Glory & Machination"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 0, "average": 0}, "utc_offset": 3600000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/Boardgame-Monkeys-Brussels/events/215934232/", "group": {"who": "Monkeys", "name": "Boardgame Monkeys Brussels", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1371725010000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "Boardgame-Monkeys-Brussels", "id": 9011652}, "description": "<p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/9/4/600_412784692.jpeg\" /></p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/8/3/e/600_426730302.jpeg\" /></p> <p>An oldie but a goodie!</p> <p>Tikal is a game of exploration within the Central American jungles in search of lost temples and the treasures within.

Each ship has six Bridge Stations:</p> <p>Engineering generates power for the other stations.Helm maneuvers the ship on the map. Weapons loads the torpedo tubes to attack the enemy.

So there are two options:</p> <p><br/>\u2022 Would anyone want to organize the meetup while I'm away? I can take care of getting the room beforehand so all you'll need to do is maybe have some topics and prepare something to talk about.</p> <p>\u2022 If not, we can do it in February when I'm back.</p> <p><br/>Cheers!</p> <p>Yoran</p>", "created": 1387357749000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "Salle Azzar at Betacowork / ICAB", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.4002, "address_1": "4 Rue des P\u00e8res Blancs, 1040 Etterbeek", "country": "be", "lat": 50.82674, "id": 20040322}, "updated": 1400191867000, "visibility": "public", "how_to_find_us": "You need a card to get access to the ICAB, please call me on 0495991722 or shoot me an email when you're there.

Ember.js 1.6 was released recently.

The <a href=\"http://jsonapi.org/\">jsonapi.org</a> initiative was launched recently as an attempt to standardize the JSON communication between server and browser.

This is an opportunity to learn from an expert, how to develop a strong business proposition.<br/>Below, you will find information about the workshop, the workshop leader\u2019s bio, together with location, joining instructions and cost and participation fees.</p> <p>About the workshop:</p> <p>\u201cMaking every word count\u201d</p> <p>One of the main ways we build our businesses is by networking. People, as they say, buy from people.</p> <p>However, what do we say when we meet potential customers which will make us stand out as the best people to solve their urgent problems?</p> <p>A strong business proposition is one key to success, and in difficult economic times our propositions have to be more compelling than ever to persuade potential customers to invest in our products and services rather than simply to hang onto their money.</p> <p>This workshop will make available to you the tools and techniques developed by Mud Valley (<a href=\"http://www.mudvalley.co.uk\"><a href=\"http://www.mudvalley\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.mudvalley</a>....</a>) and used by major organisations \u2013 business owners and consultancies \u2013 across the world to systematise their approach to developing fresh, compelling propositions.</p> <p>The techniques include:</p> <p>1. \u201cUnique market definition\u201d \u2013 what can you offer your customers that is unique?<br/>2. \u201cCustomer laddering\u201d \u2013 what do your target customers really want, deep down?<br/>3. \u201cAttacking the market leader\u201d \u2013 use your competitors\u2019 strength to your own advantage<br/>4. \u201cOutright proposition ownership\u201d \u2013 develop your fresh, compelling proposition<br/>5. \u201cElevator speech\u201d \u2013 distil your proposition down to one persuasive sentence</p> <p>Participants will also be given a free Mud Valley 20-pager e-booklet on formulating strong business propositions, plus twelve key tools, built in Excel, to enable you to build on your experiences during this workshop as your business develops.</p> <p>If you can bring along a laptop, you will be able to use these tools live during the session \u2013 however, while this is desirable it is not critical. The workshop will first and foremost be built around a lively discussion in which you can use the resources of fellow-attendees to help you become a winner in your chosen market.</p> <p><br/>The workshop leader:</p> <p>Biography</p> <p>Tim Hewtson le Roux is the Managing Director of Mud Valley and Valley Strategies (the consultancy arm of Mud Valley).</p> <p>He set up Mud Valley with five fellow directors to share knowledge of \u201cbest practice\u201d business and brand marketing strategy techniques with other practitioners. It is Mud Valley\u2019s belief that a good strategy built in-house with full involvement from the eventual implementers of that strategy will nearly always out-perform strategies developed by outside consultancies, as the success of a strategy ultimately lies in its committed execution.</p> <p>Before setting up Valley Strategies in 2006, Tim Hewtson le Roux was the Brand Strategy Manager EMEA for a major global corporation, where he was involved in the improved professionalism of how its brands were managed (which included driving through a significant brand rationalisation programme), and then Strategy &amp; Planning Manager EMEA for the same company where he worked with a hand-picked MBA team to develop human systems to identify the best market opportunities for 40 businesses across 60 countries, and then to reallocate resources accordingly. This technique led to five groups of companies turning around their business performance almost immediately, including one which had been in decline for 10 years.</p> <p>Tim is also the author of several fictional novels, including \u201cGirl on a Bar Stool\u201d which showcases brand marketing techniques and issues throughout the plot. It has been likened to Eliyahu M. Goldratt\u2019s \u201cThe Goal\u201d, the groundbreaking fictional explanation of process quality techniques.</p> <p>Workshop location, date and timing:</p> <p>Thursday 27 November - 09h30 to 14h30</p> <p>Expatica Caf\u00e9<br/>(Le Pablos)<br/>Rue Fran\u00e7ois Gay, 152<br/>Woluwe-Saint-Pierre<br/>1150 Brussels</p> <p>(Corner of Avenue du val D\u2019or)<br/>Tram; 39 &amp; 44 \u2013 stop; Chien Vert or Jules Ceaser<br/>Metro; Montgomery</p> <p><br/>Registration and Fees:</p> <p>Investment per person is \u20ac150.00, which includes handouts, tea, coffee, water during the workshop and a 2 course lunch, with drinks, in the Restaurant Le Pablos.</p> <p>You place will only be confirmed once payment has been received.<br/>Maximum of 8 participants for this workshop.</p> <p><br/>To register, please contact Chalks:</p> <p>[masked]<br/>www.expatica.com<br/>GSM:[masked]<br/>Tel:[masked]</p>", "name": "Workshop - Meet the Expert @ Expatica Caf\u00e9, Brussels", "created": 1227103014000, "rsvp_limit": 8, "venue": {"city": "Sint-Pieters-Woluwe", "name": "Le Pablos", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.424643, "phone": "+3227707015", "address_1": "Fran\u00e7ois Gaystraat 152", "address_2": "1150", "country": "be", "lat": 50.837623, "id": 765384}, "updated": 1227948190000, "visibility": "public", "how_to_find_us": "Small Group - I will meet everyone and get the workshop started.", "yes_rsvp_count": 1, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/socialNIB/events/9192432/", "time": 1227774600000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 1, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "9192432", "photo_url": "http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/4/e/0/global_6197632.jpeg"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 2, "average": 4}, "utc_offset": 3600000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/socialNIB/events/9234706/", "group": {"who": "Special People", "name": "People To People International (Europe) asbl", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1182537901000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "socialNIB", "id": 534551}, "description": "<p>Expatica meet the wine expert Event @ Expatica Caf\u00e9, Brussels</p> <p>The festive season is fast approaching with all the year-end functions and Christmas shopping ahead.

People, as they say, buy from people.</p> <p>However, what do we say when we meet potential customers which will make us stand out as the best people to solve their urgent problems?</p> <p>A strong business proposition is one key to success, and in difficult economic times our propositions have to be more compelling than ever to persuade potential customers to invest in our products and services rather than simply to hang onto their money.</p> <p>This workshop will make available to you the tools and techniques developed by Mud Valley (<a href=\"http://www.mudvalley.co.uk\"><a href=\"http://www.mudvalley\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.mudvalley</a>....</a>) and used by major organisations \u2013 business owners and consultancies \u2013 across the world to systematise their approach to developing fresh, compelling propositions.</p> <p><b>The techniques include:</b></p> <p>1. \u201cUnique market definition\u201d \u2013 what can you offer your customers that is unique?<br/>2. \u201cCustomer laddering\u201d \u2013 what do your target customers really want, deep down?<br/>3. \u201cAttacking the market leader\u201d \u2013 use your competitors\u2019 strength to your own advantage<br/>4. \u201cOutright proposition ownership\u201d \u2013 develop your fresh, compelling proposition<br/>5. \u201cElevator speech\u201d \u2013 distil your proposition down to one persuasive sentence</p> <p>Participants will also be given a free Mud Valley 20-pager e-booklet on formulating strong business propositions, plus twelve key tools, built in Excel, to enable you to build on your experiences during this workshop as your business develops.</p> <p>If you can bring along a laptop, you will be able to use these tools live during the session \u2013 however, while this is desirable it is not critical. The workshop will first and foremost be built around a lively discussion in which you can use the resources of fellow-attendees to help you become a winner in your chosen market.</p> <p><b><br/>The workshop leader:</b></p> <p>Biography</p> <p>Tim Hewtson le Roux is the Managing Director of Mud Valley and Valley Strategies (the consultancy arm of Mud Valley).</p> <p>He set up Mud Valley with five fellow directors to share knowledge of \u201cbest practice\u201d business and brand marketing strategy techniques with other practitioners. It is Mud Valley\u2019s belief that a good strategy built in-house with full involvement from the eventual implementers of that strategy will nearly always out-perform strategies developed by outside consultancies, as the success of a strategy ultimately lies in its committed execution.</p> <p>Before setting up Valley Strategies in 2006, Tim Hewtson le Roux was the Brand Strategy Manager EMEA for a major global corporation, where he was involved in the improved professionalism of how its brands were managed (which included driving through a significant brand rationalisation programme), and then Strategy &amp; Planning Manager EMEA for the same company where he worked with a hand-picked MBA team to develop human systems to identify the best market opportunities for 40 businesses across 60 countries, and then to reallocate resources accordingly.

How could he help his team members to be more creative?\u201d So he began 15 years ago to study brain and mind behaviour and to apply what he learned first to himself and then to his client teams.</p> <p>So in this workshop, Serge will share with you what he learned and give you the opportunity to practice accessing your creativity:</p> <p>1. How do we make creative decisions based on the latest brain research?<br/>You will understand why we have difficulty to access our creative brain and what the warning signals are.</p> <p>2. What are the access doors to the creative brain?<br/>You will get easy to follow resources to access more often the creative part of your brain.</p> <p>3. How can I help my team become more creative &amp; aligned?<br/>You will learn proven approaches to develop team behaviours which unleash team creativity. And you will get the opportunity to practice powerful creativity team techniques.</p> <p>About the expert<br/>Serge Pegoff is an independent coach helping senior and middle managers to evolve their behaviors to successfully handle new challenges. Serge has coached more than 40 senior and middle managers and more than 60 business teams in the following organizations: Fortis Bank, AXA, CIC Group, Suez, Bayer, Electrabel, AG Insurance, Belgacom, Cisco, KPN (Netherlands), Swisscom, Carrefour, Guiness, GlaxoSmithKline.\u2026</p> <p>Serge is an accredited Associate Member from the SFCoach (\u201cSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Coaching\u201d) and an Action Learning Coach from the WIAL (World Institute for Action Learning).

Among such fans, much interest has been shown in going further in their quest for knowledge. A \u201cMaster Class\u201d is designed for devotees who wish to understand the whisky production process (in various countries), the criteria of age and quality, the maturing process, vatting techniques, how blended whisky is made and what do the Scots call \u201cpure malt\u201d?</p> <p>Participants will experience the nosing and tasting techniques used by the Master Blenders, as well as the physical changes of adding water to whisky. Seven carefully selected whiskies of different types will be presented and tasted together with expert technical guidance on how to choose one\u2019s preferred type and region of production.</p> <p>Whisky expert Malcolm J. Andrews covers all this and more in his Whisky Master Class. The subject is complex but the pleasure of knowing what whisky to choose and how to treat it is more than worth two hours of study, analysis and, yes, pleasure! And the fact that Malcolm is not only a knowledgeable but a highly entertaining speaker - is good reason why you should join us.<br/>Malcolm Andrews was born to a Scottish mother; during his childhood he played around a distillery so the reek of malting barley penetrated his soul. His whisky background is impressive. He affected market research for whisky producers to determine the strength of the Benelux market. He was appointed \u201cOutside Whisky Ambassador\u201d by the world\u2019s largest producer and has technically trained hundreds of staff in stores and supermarkets. The press refers to him as \u201cScotland\u2019s Continental Whisky Ambassador\u201d and his work takes him all over Europe presenting whisky in three different languages.</p> <p>\n\nTo register and make payment, please go to:<br/><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Expatica-Cafe-Brussels/\"><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com</a>...</a> registration is simple - once you confirm participation you will be presented with a secure service to make your payment.</p> <p>If you would prefer to make a bank transfer, here are the details<br/>Centea;[masked]<br/>IBAN; BE[masked]<br/>BIC; SPAABE22<br/>Refrence: Whisky</p> <p>Visiting us;<br/>There is some good street parking; and we can also be reached by Metro (Tomberg and Montgomery) or Tram (39 and 44).</p> <p>From Tomberg metro; walk down Avenue Henri Pauwels.

These take a similar format and typically last a whole day, often run on a weekend. The past years have seen a decline in attendance at some of these events, which could be down to the changing face of business in Europe.</p> <p>However, the needs of Expatriates and Internationals have not changed, possibly just the way they want to see those needs met or presented - this is the purpose of an Info-Fair. Rather than 1 or 2 big events each year, NBIB plans to host many smaller Info-Fairs, targeted by way of complimentary services and adding a bigger social and networking dimension. When away from home, the ability to meet new people is high on the list of needs; together with a need for services, products and tools.<br/>At NBIB, our commitment to our community comes first; and our Info-Fair will have a small range of valuable resources from previous European fairs, with attention given to community related resources for the experienced expat.</p> <p>Our first event in this new format:<br/>\u2022 Sunday 24 October 2010, 14h00 to 17h00 \u2013 Autoworld Museum (Espace53 on the first floor, overlooking the treasures of the museum)<br/>\u2022 Entrance is Free,<br/>\u2022 Stand holders and visitors will be offered basic refreshments; tea, coffee, soft drinks and simple snacks,</p> <p>Sponsorship:<br/>At NBIB, our commitment to our community comes first. For this reason, we offer a very competitive price to stand holders, supported by visibility either in-print or on-line with our respected media partners. We also promote our events at International schools, businesses and locations where International people like to visit.</p> <p>\u2022 The lead media partner is Expatica Communications www.expatica.com/be - supporting us with on-line banners and news letters. We shall also host online with Away Magazine <a href=\"http://www.awaymagazine.be/\"><a href=\"http://www.awaymagazi\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.awaymagazi</a>...</a>. Print ads will be placed in the Bulletin and Up Front magazine. Other media partnerships are under consideration.<br/>\u2022 A poster will be circulated to all major locations where Expats and Internationals are part of the community, with a request to place this in a prominent place,<br/>\u2022 Some of the profits from this event will be given to Europe\u2019s Children Our Concern (ECOC) www.ecoc.be for their Children In Need 2010 Appeal.</p> <p>Location:<br/>Our first Info-Fair will be hosted at our partner location Espace53 (www.espace53.be), first floor, Autoworld Museum, Parc du Cinquantenaire 11, 1000 Brussels</p> <p>Visiting Autoworld (<a href=\"http://www.autoworld.be/en/10.asp);\"><a href=\"http://www.autoworld\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.autoworld</a>....</a><br/>There is parking for up to 600 cars and Metro stops Merode and Schuman are but a short walk away.</p> <p>Please use Google Maps (<a href=\"http://maps.google.com/\"><a href=\"http://maps.google.co\" class=\"linkified\">http://maps.google.co</a>...</a>) to find the best way to get to us from where you are \u2013 either by private or public transport.</p> <p>Contact<br/><b>Networking Business In Belgium, &amp;<br/>Extraordinary Moments In Time</b><br/>rue Francois Gay 152<br/>1150 Brussels<br/>Woluwe-Saint-Pierre<br/>Belgium</p> <p><b>Chalks Corriette</b><br/>Managing Director</p> <p><b>Tel:[masked]</b><br/>Fax:[masked]<br/>Cell/Mobile:[masked]</p> <p>[masked]<br/><b><a href=\"http://www.nbib.biz\"><a href=\"http://www.nbib.biz\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.nbib.biz</a>...</a></b></p>", "created": 1284721147000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "Espace53 (Autoworld)", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.391123, "phone": "0478.482023", "address_1": "11 Parc du Cinquantenaire, 1000", "country": "be", "lat": 50.84034, "id": 307694}, "updated": 1287996469000, "visibility": "public", "name": "NBIB Info-Fair - Autoworld Museum, Brussels 1000", "yes_rsvp_count": 18, "time": 1287921600000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 85, "maybe_rsvp_count": 2, "id": "14801668", "photo_url": "http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/e/5/4/global_9580532.jpeg"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 1, "average": 4}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "fee": {"description": "per person", "required": "0", "accepts": "paypal", "label": "Price", "currency": "EUR", "amount": 20}, "group": {"who": "Special People", "name": "People To People International (Europe) asbl", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1182537901000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "socialNIB", "id": 534551}, "description": "<p>Announcing a new Meetup for Networking Business In Belgium (NBIB)!</p> <p><b>What</b>: <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/NetworkingBIB/calendar/14819470/\">Make the Law of attraction work for you</a></p> <p><b>When</b>: Tuesday, October 5,[masked]:00 PM</p> <p><b>Price</b>: EUR20.00 per person</p> <p><b>Where</b>: Expatica Cafe<br/>rue Francois Gay 152<br/>Sint-Pieters-Woluwe<br/>[masked]</p> <p>Make the Law of attraction work for you</p> <p>Tuesday 5 October 2010 \u2013 19h00 to 21h00</p> <p>One52 (Expatica Caf\u00e9)<br/>First floor meeting room<br/>Rue Francois Gay 152<br/>Woluwe-Saint-Pierre<br/>1150 Brussels</p> <p>Join us for a learning workshop.

He questioned himself and tried to answer the question, how body-work could have such a positive impact on behavior?</p> <p>In his interactive presentation, Tom will bring you an answer to this question and will share effective tools to help yourself and others relieve from the negative effects of stress and become more resilient on the way.</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.richardkelly.eu\">Richard Kelly</a></b> is a qualified Sport Therapist (using the Bowen\u00a9 and TBM\u00a9 techniques) and a Golf Specific Trainer, here in Belgium and Europe.</p> <p><br/>His work on \"stress\" is related to his clients coming for Bowen and TBM sessions, and seeing how their bodies are affected by stress....<br/>We often live our lives at a much faster and more stressful pace than our body is designed to cope with. Stress has a massive physical impact on the body, though we may often be unaware of its effects. The long-term effects of stress can be devastating. Stress makes us release adrenalin; it tenses our muscles and suppresses our digestion. It contributes to health problems such as high blood pressure, headaches, hormone imbalance, digestive problems and all kinds of muscular aches and pains.</p> <p><br/>Bowen Therapy is clinically proven to significantly reduce anxiety, tension and fatigue*. Bowen releases muscular tension and helps the body return to the \u2018parasympathetic\u2019 nervous system in which it can rest and heal itself. Through gentle movements over muscles and nerves the Bowen practitioner will target the key areas to release tension and anxiety and help get you back to you best.</p> <p>*Effects of the Bowen Technique on the Autonomic Nervous System and the Heart: by Dr Whitaker MD</p> <p><br/><b>IMPORTANT INFO:</b></p> <p><b>Registration</b>: <a href=\"http://hp2bofficebrussels.eventbrite.fr\" class=\"linkified\">http://hp2bofficebrussels.eventbrite.fr</a> or contact Tom at [masked],</p> <p><b>Contact</b>:[masked]</p> <p><b>Participation Fee</b>: 25\u20ac</p>", "created": 1365589094000, "venue": {"city": "1170 Brussels", "name": "Office Brussels", "repinned": true, "lon": 4.424645, "address_1": "34 Boulevard du Souverain ", "country": "be", "lat": 50.803066, "id": 12759722}, "updated": 1367148417000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 9, "time": 1366995600000, "duration": 10800000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "113621892", "name": "Understanding & Managing Stress"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 6, "average": 4}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/socialNIB/events/115640662/", "group": {"who": "Special People", "name": "People To People International (Europe) asbl", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1182537901000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "socialNIB", "id": 534551}, "description": "<p>Premi\u00e8re in the Shuman area !</p> <p>Join us for an expat afterwork in the most beautiful venue of the Shuman area, on tuesday april 30th starting from 6 PM.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/9/d/e/event_228027102.jpeg\" /></p> <p>First 50 to arrive will get a free caipirinha, happy hour until 7 PM.<br/>tapas and other things available for those who feel like eating something.</p> <p>2 floors and 2 musical ambiances.

He is a comedy superstar and has performed all over the world. He hosts his own one-man show at the Edinburgh Fringe festival. He is known as one of the foremost foreign comedians on the UK comedy circuit and headlines clubs across Europe regularly.</p> <p><b>Soula Notos</b> (GRE) - Born and raised in Holland in a Greek family. Crisis indeed! She knows it by heart. Growing up with shouting and gesturing relatives (small bodies, lots of movement), the only relief was comedy. And now, close to her well deserved pension, she loves to tell stories filled with self-mockery to as many people as possible. She has performed at the Free Fringe in Edinburgh, in Manchester, at the International Women\u2019s Festival in Greece and many clubs and venues across Europe. \"Great Energy.

Louis has a like-able connection with the audience when he performs. He often talks to the audience, making jokes with the crowd and letting them become part of the action. Louis likes to make fun of cultural differences, and have a poke at everyone.</p> <p><b>Stewart Johnson</b> (USA) - has a knack for picking out the obvious yet hidden quirks in society and turning them into laughs you will never forget. He is an American who is based in Estonia, and has a more mainstream, non-offensive style, frequently drawing upon his experiences as a father. A witty, observational style that will tickle every single one of your funny bones.</p> <p>Tickets online here : <a href=\"http://www.ticketlib.com/standupmay\">www.ticketlib.com/standupmay</a> (save about 4\u20ac in presale, it will be 25\u20ac at the door)</p>", "created": 1366288483000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "Bouche-\u00e0-Oreille theater", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.390471, "address_1": "Rue F\u00e9lix Hap 11, 1040 Brussels", "country": "be", "lat": 50.837231, "id": 9558162}, "updated": 1370285751000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 20, "time": 1369159200000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "114957882", "name": "English Comedy Night"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 1, "average": 5}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/socialNIB/events/117816632/", "group": {"who": "Special People", "name": "People To People International (Europe) asbl", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1182537901000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "socialNIB", "id": 534551}, "description": "<p><b>Job Club and Coffee Mornings</b></p> <p><b>Every Thursday 09h00 to 14h00</b></p> <p><br/><b>The</b> People To People International coffee morning is an informal get-together where our community can have a chat and enjoy some time with other international people living and working in Belgium.

From resisting to fixing, to finally mining for life's wisdom, the question I am living right now is; \" What if life isn't happening to me? What if, life is responding to me?\"</p> <p>I love to share and connect with people, in a training/coaching capacity and otherwise, in celebrating this gift we hold as life!</p> <p>So, let's co-create a picnic, with fun, socializing, meaningful conversations and with light sport (frisbee, badminton etc)! I will be there with some friends and bring along some food, drinks, a blanket and some sports stuff too. Do join us with your friends and family, more the merrier ;-)</p> <p>We'll be in the area of the park with the entrance from Av. de Nerviens.

And when she\u2019s not performing as a comedian, she acts in movies and television series, such as Band Of Brothers.</p> <p>Wilko Terwijn (NL) belongs to the top of the Dutch standup comedy. Armed with a microphone, he guides the audience into his sharp, but twisted mind, where lurks a strange twist at every turn. Brutally he discusses what should be discussed and is not afraid of dissent. Wilko is always up to date and innovative, so no show will be the same.</p> <p>William Sutton (UK) is the English-born son of Scottish parents. William was the first native English-speaking comedian in the Netherlands in 1995. Stand-up comedy wasn\u2019t well known in the Netherlands when he started but over 400 shows later (many of which were in the Comedy Caf\u00e9 in Amsterdam) William has proven that both comedy and he himself are there to stay.</p> <p>Jurg Van Ginkel (NL) won the stand-up concours at the Amsterdams Kleinkunstfestival in 2008, and is known for his dark jokes, bizarre fantasies and is not afraid of hard rough either. He's often mistaken for a really poncy native speaker because of his laboratory-bred English accent, Jurg also regularly performs and comperes in English.</p> <p>\n\n\n\nTickets in advance: 20 euro</p> <p><br/>Tickets at the door: 25 euro</p> <p><br/>Get your tickets at:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ticketlib.com/standupnov\"><a href=\"http://www.ticketlib.com/standupnov\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.ticketlib.com/standupnov</a></a></p>", "created": 1383152162000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "Bouche-\u00e0-Oreille theater", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.390471, "address_1": "Rue F\u00e9lix Hap 11, 1040 Brussels", "country": "be", "lat": 50.837231, "id": 9558162}, "updated": 1385568169000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 13, "time": 1384887600000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 120, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "148267392", "name": "Brussels English Comedy Night -

For example, going for financial success without a breakthrough in your relationship to financial success can be very frustrating.\u00a0</p> <p><br/>Its not just a goal setting and new year planning workshop, but a context to create breakthroughs that would make the achievement of your goals an experience of flow and ease.</p> <p><br/>Join us for a transformative Sunday afternoon on Jan 26 in Brussels.

Particular things you'd really like to achieve this year? Is it a new car, a new relationship, a new job, a new house, the dream vacation, starting your own business, moving abroad, better relationship with your parents and/or children and basically any thing that would give you a more fulfilling experience of life?</p> <p><br/>Come to think of it though, haven't you tried making at least some of these changes before?</p> <p><br/>Consider this perspective: What you do comes from who you are. Doing is a function of Being. So the results of what you do come from who you are Being while you do what you do. And the results of what you do and what you don't do (which is also an action, a choice) determines the conditions of your life.</p> <p><br/>By 'who you are' I mean the story you have about yourself, the beliefs, the past conditioning, memories and the unconscious content that make up your identity. For example, let's suppose you decide on improving your fitness and for that, you decide to go for a jog every morning. Now if your story is 'I'm not a morning person,' how many morning jogs do you think you will manage?</p> <p><br/>And what if you set a goal to make lots of money but the unconscious belief you have running is 'I don't deserve wealth' or 'money is the root of all evil'? And one has internal beliefs about every area of life like this. You can see how this internal conflict can sabotage even the loftiest of goals in any area of life.</p> <p><br/>Did you change partners but experience similar relationship problems? Change jobs but have similar financial problems? If you're experiencing frustration in certain areas of your life, who you are may be working against what you desire!</p> <p><br/>Dr. Wayne Dyer put it best: \"You don't attract what you want, you attract what you are!\"</p> <p><br/>Take a good look at your life right now. What you have and experience is basically a reflection of who you are. If you commit to something that is outside your experience right now, you would have to grow into someone who you are not yet. You have to break the habit of Being you.\u00a0</p> <p><br/>What you need is a Breakthrough, a breakthrough is Who YOU are such that the results you desire can be with you. That is exactly the purpose for this space, 'Let's make 2014 a year of Breakthroughs!'</p> <p><br/>What you can expect from this experience:</p> <p><br/>\u2022\u00a0Taking the lessons from 2013 and closing the chapter so that space is created for new creations in 2014.</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Clarity over your goals and what Breakthroughs are needed for their achievement.</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Going for the Breakthroughs: a group coaching process will facilitate the Breakthrough process such that 'who you are' works for you, not against.</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Strategies for continuous focus and managing ups and downs.</p> <p><br/>So much more than being just a goal setting workshop, the invitation is for you to create internal alignment so that you become a magnet for goals!</p> <p>If you are experiencing frustration in some area(s) of your life; if you have had dreams/ideas and have been held back by fear; if your life is good, you\u2019re comfortable with things yet you have this inner feeling that you have more potential in you than what you are living and you would like to get to the next level of success, then this is the space for you.</p>", "created": 1388930064000, "venue": {"city": "1040 Brussels", "name": "Aloft Brussels Schuman", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.379961, "address_1": "Place Jean Rey", "country": "be", "lat": 50.840488, "id": 1561787}, "updated": 1390946660000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 18, "time": 1390743000000, "duration": 12600000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "158752032", "name": "Let's make 2014 a year of Breakthroughs!"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 1, "average": 4}, "utc_offset": 3600000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/socialNIB/events/153965892/", "group": {"who": "Special People", "name": "People To People International (Europe) asbl", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1182537901000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "socialNIB", "id": 534551}, "description": "<p>Another great comedy show, not to be missed to begin the year with the best of moods !</p> <p><br/><i>For roughly 400 years, the United Kingdom and the United States have been\u2026well\u2026 united\u2026 in a relationship that runs the gamut from intimate to frosty.

He has spread Swedish comedy all over the world in places like Russia, India, South Africa, Finland, France, Germany, Belgium, UK, Estonia, China, etc. His comedy style mixes observational comedy with an absurdist touch, all in a high energy physical stage persona. In 2013 he toured with his solo show \"It\u00b4s the Flourist\u2019s Fault\".</p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/f/4/c/600_346248972.jpeg\" /></p> <p>\n\n\n<b>Brian Jordan USA</b></p> <p>Brian is an American based in Sweden. He has seen the best of the best live at the famous Punchline in Atlanta, but Brian has developed his own style of storytelling comedy. They say that part truth is involved in most comedians\u2019 stories, and Brian is no different. If you figure out which parts of his stories are true, they could shock you. He has been in commercials, lent his voice for audiobooks, and is looking forward to his first movie role, should one come along.</p> <p><b>Claus Reiss DK</b></p> <p>Best Bagpipe Comedy Show in Europe...\u2026and the only one. The Danish comedian Claus Reiss is the only man in Europe who also entertains with the bagpipe. He uses the odd instrument to play well-known tunes, but in a most untraditional way. He spices up his performance with storytelling and jokes in a close interaction with the audience. Claus Reiss has been on the international comedy circuit for several years now attending some of the world\u2019s biggest comedy festivals. His shows have made people laugh across Europe due to his surprising mixture of bagpipe music, comedy and improvisation.</p> <p><b>Manu Moreau BEL</b></p> <p>Is he a bird, is he a plane? Well, if he\u2019s up that high, he must be insane! From a small township to the big city, he\u2019s been there, done that and sold the t-shirt. His first steps in comedy weren\u2019t so long ago, but every step since has been closely monitored for your safety. His comedy works similar to cocaine: one line after the other, very addictive.</p> <p><b>Soula Notos GRE</b></p> <p>Originally from Greece, but now based in Utrecht, she has fantastic energy on stage and a quick-wittedness only to adore and admire.

And if you didn't ask me, I'd still have to say it!\u201d</i></p> <p>- George Burns</p> <p>It can be said that almost every successful person has his/her challenges with stress. Stress is something that happens when we get overwhelmed by things happening in our lives. Breaking it down further, the only time we experience stress is when our attention leaves the present moment and we get caught up with possible future scenarios that may or may not even happen. One of my favorite quotes around this is from Mark Twain when he says, \u201c<i>I\u2019ve known a great many troubles, most of which never happened!\u201d</i></p> <p>If you\u2019re a student, the exams are stressful. When you\u2019re about to graduate, finding a job is stressful. If you get a job, performance and promotions are stressful. If you\u2019re single, that is stressful. If you get in a relationship, even more stressful :) and so the stages go on\u2026</p> <p>I invite you to consider the perspective that it may not be the circumstances that are stressful; they just are. May be it\u2019s our response, our way of relating to these facts that creates the condition of stress. That may be the stress is coming from our inability to manage our own system, our mind, body and emotions. That stress is a condition created when the inner dimensions of our Being are in friction.</p> <p>Wayne Dyer put this in the following words:</p> <p><i>\u201cThe components of anxiety, stress, fear, and anger do not exist independently of you in the world. They simply do not exist in the physical world, even though we talk about them as if they do.\u201d</i></p> <p>At a grander level, whatever we experience as a society is a collective manifestation of what\u2019s happening in individual minds. And if the great majority of our individual minds are in regular stress, how can we realistically bring peace and balance to the world?</p> <p>If we can create stress within ourselves, we can surely transcend it and create ease and a peaceful inner presence instead. It\u2019s a question of breaking the pattern of stress, learning and then habituating the processes for creating this inner well-being!</p> <p>Has there been a time you were stressed? Are you experiencing some degree of stress at present? Do certain things about your future stress you up? Do you know people who seem to stress you out? Has stress been a theme for you? This might just be the space for you!</p> <p>The processes and insights you can expect from this workshop are:</p> <p>\u2022 Understanding stress \u2013 the role of perception and the biological response</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Identifying the causes of stress \u2013 expectations, attachments and dependency</p> <p>\u2022 The\u00a02 truths to stop being in stress mode immediately</p> <p>\u2022\u00a05 key strategies to transcend and transform stress</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Breaking through stress inducing thinking for which there\u2019s even a smartphone app!</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0Stress release meditation</p> <p>\u2022\u00a0From stress management to proactive stress avoidance!</p> <p>In the spirit of invitation, this event carries a reduced tag of only 10 EUR and can be paid on the spot.</p> <p>Join us for this exciting Saturday afternoon on June 14 in Brussels.

There is also a total eclipse of the moon that is happening the same day (in Brussels is happening around noon Oct 8).</p> <p><br/>The total eclipse represents a time where the portal of the subconscious will be \"locked\" for a while and people will have a chance to look deeper into the reasons of their beliefs and inspirations or sufferings. You can have a chance to make deep changes in your life at this time (if you are ready and willing).\u00a0</p> <p>So join us for a deep spiritual transformational shamanic ritual with the drum and the tarot cards!</p> <p>Participation cost 20 euro - For the intention<br/>Bring with you warm clothes and flash light!

The first ever Startup Weekend in Antwerp is here!</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/0/8/2/600_400268322.jpeg\" /></p> <p>With over 1,800 past events in 500 cities around the world, Startup Weekend is the biggest global grassroots movement of active and empowered entrepreneurs who are learning the basics of founding startups and launching successful ventures.</p> <p><br/>Have you ever felt the urge to:</p> <p>- Pitch your idea?<br/>- Form a team around your idea and make it real?<br/>- Get grilled by some of the toughest industry experts<br/>- Get coached by the best<br/>- Present to a panel of expert judges and win amazing prizes?<br/>- And test the limits of sleeplessness? ;)</p> <p>If the answer is yes, then chances are, you\u2019re a crazy-ass entrepreneur and you should probably join Startup Weekend in Antwerp!</p> <p>This will be the 1st event of its kind in Antwerp where the local startup ecosystem will join in for a three day marathon of co-creation, co-learning and growth-hacking!</p> <p>Check out the Startup Weekend trailer here:</p> <p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/28872840\" class=\"embedded\">http://vimeo.com/28872840</a></p> <p>All Startup Weekend events follow the same basic model: anyone is welcome to pitch their startup idea and receive feedback from their peers. Teams organically form around the top ideas (as determined by popular vote) and then it\u2019s a 54 hour frenzy of business model creation, coding, designing, business coaching and market validation. The weekends culminate with presentations in front of local entrepreneurial leaders with another opportunity for critical feedback. It isn\u2019t always pretty. It will be challenging and can be grueling. But, if you can stick it out, you will have gained the equivalent of months worth of learning, building, and networking in one weekend. Hell, you might even start your first company!</p> <p>Whether you start companies, find a cofounder, meet someone new, or learn a skill far outside the usual 9-to-5, everyone is guaranteed to leave the event better prepared to navigate the chaotic but fun world of startups. The event will be held in English.</p> <p>More details and event schedule <a href=\"http://www.up.co/communities/belgium/antwerp/startup-weekend/3910\">here</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SWAntwerp\">Startup Weekend Antwerp</a>\ufeff is expected to sell out well in advance so <a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.com/e/startup-weekend-antwerp-tickets-12165572555?aff=UP+Community+Sites\">book</a> your place now!</p> <p>The prices here includes event materials, business coaching, mentoring, working space for the weekend and meals and snacks for the whole weekend (Friday till Sunday dinner)!</p> <p>You can work overnight at the venue as well.

But why does it not come naturally? Why is it often a struggle to achieve and maintain this?</p> <p>How often do we feel stuck and frustrated in our lives because of the same old negative patterns that tend to not go away, no matter how hard we try? It seems sometimes almost impossible to turn things really around, not just for a moment. Think about those days that you wake up and your thinking and feeling says: today is not my day? But what if exactly on that day you need to give an important presentation or are having an important meeting? How do you manage yourself? In general, what do we need to do differently in order to overcome fears, insecurities, negative self-talk, and other negative sabotaging patterns and to become the creator of our reality and experiences?</p> <p>The first step would be to become AWARE of how you function as a human being. You need to know exactly what determines how you behave, think, feel, act and experience reality. What makes you tick, what drives you? Why do you do what you do and feel what you feel? You need to find out what is holding you back and what stands in between you and doing what you really want to do and being who you want to be. Once you become aware of what shaped your life and yourself, you can take the second step: acquire the power to start setting yourself free from limitations and breaking down the wall of negative conditioning that has been determining most of your life so far.</p> <p>Master I \u2013 A new state of consciousness takes you through these two steps, and even further. You will see for yourself how consciousness is the crucial factor to gain control over negative sabotaging patterns and to finally create a self-determined reality. You will gain new awareness, connection to your inner power, clarity on your way forward, and practical tools needed for creating your life the way you choose to.</p> <p>How does Master I work?</p> <p>Master I is a dynamic and holistic training process facilitated by an international team of our highly skilled trainers. We create a safe space in which you can internalize and directly implement new knowledge instead of just receiving information. Each training day contains inquiries and awareness creations combined with exercises and individual as well as group process designed to integrate the insights you acquire. A comprehensive training workbook supports the process.</p> <p>Master I main themes:</p> <p>Freedom \u2013 feel free, act free, be free<br/>Passion \u2013 create the life you love to live<br/>Energy \u2013 tap into your core energy and use it for constructive purposes<br/>Clarity \u2013 see clearly what you want to accomplish in life<br/>Integrity \u2013 align your actions with your words<br/>Awareness \u2013 perceive reality as it is<br/>Authenticity \u2013 stay true to who you choose to be<br/>Presence \u2013 be fully in the here and now<br/>Love \u2013 love without conditions<br/>Action \u2013 act independently from thinking and feeling<br/>and much more\u2026.</p> <p>As the result of Master I, you will acquire new life skills and develop daily practices that will lead you towards creating major lasting shifts in your life.</p> <p>Master I is a personal development training well as the foundation training of the coach training curriculum and a prerequisite for becoming a Consciousness Coach\u00ae.</p> <p>What are the practical details?</p> <p>Training days<br/>Master I consists of 4 training days, from Thursday till Sunday. Each day starts at 9 am, evenings are open-ended. On Day 4 (Sunday) we finish at 6 pm sharp. All trainings take place in Brussels, Belgium. Participants are responsible to secure their own accommodation, when needed. Details on the venue and a list of accommodation possibilities will be send to registered participants.</p> <p>Your investment<br/>Price for individuals:<br/>Master I is offered on the basis of Valuation after the Experience model (VAE).<br/>This is how it works:<br/>your investment prior to the training is EUR 195 Registration fee incl. VAT, needed to book your seat and cover the logistical costs (meals, drinks, venue, training materials).<br/>On the last day of the training you decide how much you choose to pay for the value you got out of the training. You fill out the VAE form, where you indicate how much you choose to pay for the training. You can pay the full amount at once or in up to four instalments.</p> <p>Why do we offer Valuation after the Experience (VAE)?<br/>Firstly, we want to make the foundation trainings (Master I and Master II) accessible for as many people as possible.<br/>Secondly, we want to create a relationship between you and us basing on responsibility and trust. We acknowledge that attending the trainings might involve some risk for you, and we are willing to bear this risk.

If you do want to place your car on the parking behind the building you'll need a coin or badge get off the parking.</p>", "created": 1411477446000, "rsvp_limit": 50, "venue": {"city": "Antwerpen", "name": "Nucleus", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.406031, "address_1": "North Trade Building Noorderlaan 133/8", "country": "be", "lat": 51.264492, "id": 16704692}, "updated": 1411649813000, "visibility": "public", "how_to_find_us": "Nucleus' offices are located at the ground floor, just to the left of the reception in the main hall.

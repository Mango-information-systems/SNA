It takes up the whole of Grand Place, so you can't miss it</p> <p>Here's the home page for the fest: <a href=\"http://www.belgianbrewers.be/en/events/belgian-beer-weekend-171/\"><a href=\"http://www.belgianbrewers.be/en/events/belgian-beer-weekend-171/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.belgianbrewers.be/en/events/belgian-beer-weekend-171/</a></a></p> <p>It gets very busy and the best time to go is at the start of the session (hence 11.00am start for me).</p> <p>Like last year, the plan is to stay until 2pm ish and then review things - I suspect, if still standing, the professional drinkers will move elsewhere (nearby but not so close that we run into other fest escapees)</p> <p>Clearly, meeting up will be tricky. I'll keep an eye/ear out for calls and texts (0497/053166).</p> <p>We shall aim to meet at the bottom left corner (please refer to the map below), around stands 30 to 33 &amp; just try to get together as best we can.</p> <p>We buy beer tokens (plus one for the glass deposit too!) first, then swap those for beer after. There are separate pay desks for those (\u20ac symbols on the map below). Apparently you have to buy 10 beer tokens as a minimum (was this always like that?). Depending on the beers you get this is about 4 beers. Probably some of you don't intend to drink that much, so my plan is to buy a bigger quantitiy of beer and glass tokens in advance, which you can then get from me, in case you only intend to drink a few beers. When those run out, I suggest you pair up with somebody else, and 1 person gets the tokens. In any case, please check in with the group first, before going to the pay desks! That way we can avoid that everyone is buying too many tokens. Let's see how it goes... Furthermore, it seems the pay desks will be open for some time already on Thursday and Friday, so probably will be less queues then.</p> <p><br/>Weather forecast looks ok-ish at the moment, will keep an eye on it and update as needed.</p> <p><br/>Cheers, David</p> <p>The Map:</p> <p><br/>\u00a0</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/c/2/4/e/600_278089742.jpeg\" /></p>", "created": 1377864356000, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "Brewers'House", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.352593, "address_1": "Grand'Place 10", "address_2": "1000 BRUSSELS ", "country": "be", "lat": 50.846398, "id": 1309113}, "updated": 1378844501000, "visibility": "public", "how_to_find_us": "Bottom left corner of Grand Place (refer to map below), between stand 30-33.

Expect lots of lederhosen, humptata\u00a0music and of course plenty of beer distributed non-stop by the numerous beer maids! Also plenty of German food and snacks available.</p> <p>The first few days are already fully booked, so I put our visit on Sunday evening.

I have booked 3 tables, so space for 24 people, and this is pretty strict! The organisation will not allow people to\u00a0stay if they don't have a space at a table. Being Sunday night there might be some unbooked tables, but I can't guarantee that! So I recommend you only show\u00a0up if you have RSVPd Yes. Otherwise it's likely you won't have a space. Furthermore they expect people to arrive between 18h and 19h. After that I think that\u00a0the\u00a0organizers\u00a0are free to give the untaken spaces away!

Obviously, we had everything planned out while being in a festive mood and then never got around to doing this. But now we set a date and it will go through, come what may.</p> <p>This week we will be exploring the bars flying the rainbow flag, aka the small yet lively Brussels offer of gay bars. Therefore, no selection of bars based on a fine offer of beers, but the usual suspects will be readily available. This is still Belgium, and don\u2019t you forget it!</p> <p>We will have a small choice of 2 bars, with an after trek special for those of you up for more fun.</p> <p>20:00 Meeting point will be at Caf\u00e9 Fontainas (Kolenmarkt 91) on the terrace if the weather allows it and inside if winter\u2019s back. So let\u2019s all hope for good weather as this is one of the nicest terraces in Brussels. They even have some food so if you\u2019re feeling peckish\u2026</p> <p>Then we\u2019ll move on a couple of steps to Le Belgica (Kolenmarkt 32) at about 21:30-22:00: A dive joint built around the remains of a 1920's bar, yes it's that old, and transformed into a grunge bar before becoming a gay bar in 1994. Everywhere you will find reminders of the Belgian Monarchy. The bronze bust of Leopold II sits nobly above the public still enjoying the victory over his kidnappers. Leopold II has always been a heavyweight.</p> <p>And if this is not enough for one evening for you hardcore trekkies we can then move on to a 3rd bar. For those still not ready to end the evening, from 1 am onwards fabulous drag queen shows can be enjoyed at Chez Maman</p> <p>Some details:</p> <p>Due to the relative size of the bars, this bar trek will be small. Please be accurate with your RSVPs and sign out if you can\u2019t make it.</p> <p>Please be respectful of the space and people. Gay bars are places where members of the LGBT community can hang out without having to deal with homophobia.</p> <p>Nearest metro stations are Bourse and Brouckere</p> <p>If you get lost give me a call/text on[masked] and I'll try to guide you/tell you where we are.</p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Sabine</p>", "created": 1395135226000, "rsvp_limit": 15, "venue": {"city": "Brussels", "name": "Cafe Fontainas", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.34747, "address_1": "Kolenmarkt 91", "country": "be", "lat": 50.84552, "id": 19063262}, "updated": 1395440714000, "visibility": "public", "how_to_find_us": "TBC", "yes_rsvp_count": 15, "time": 1395428400000, "waitlist_count": 5, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "171906422", "name": "Rainbow Bar Trek"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 3, "average": 4.329999923706055}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/The-Brussels-Bar-Trek/events/174681372/", "group": {"who": "Bar Trekkers", "name": "Brussels Bar Trek", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1272189291000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "The-Brussels-Bar-Trek", "id": 1635988}, "description": "<p>Hi all,</p> <p><br/>I'm sure many of you are again in the mood for some bar trekking, so let's do that this Saturday!</p> <p><br/>We'll try a new bar again this time: ViaVia cafe.

The number of camels within a caravan depends on he number of players. Each camel is loaded with a lot of goods, and the goal of the game is to carry all the goods from the starting position to the final oasis: Timbuktu.</p> <p>However, during the course of this journey, the caravans stop at other oases. Once all camels arrive to an oasis- and the night comes- thieves attack the caravan, and stole different goods. While moving from one oasis to another, players receive different clues about the manner of the thefts. Each player has a different clue, and although clues are passed around, one player only receives three of the total five clues. From the action of the other players \u2013 caravan leaders -, the clues have to be guessed and camels have to be relocated in order to save all the goods from the thieves.</p> <p>The next morning the caravan continues its way towards Timbuktu, and players are challenged with different clues again. The object of the game is to be the trader left with the most value in goods when you reach Timbuktu.</p> <p>Description taken from this website:<br/><a href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/691/timbuktu\" class=\"linkified\">http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/691/timbuktu</a></p>", "created": 1368272533000, "rsvp_limit": 10, "updated": 1369185509000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 8, "time": 1369157400000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "118868772", "name": "Play Timbuktu and Power Grid"}, {"status": "past", "rating": {"count": 2, "average": 5}, "utc_offset": 7200000, "event_url": "http://www.meetup.com/BoardgamersBXL_new/events/125481522/", "group": {"who": "(Board)gamers", "name": "BoardgamersBXL", "group_lat": 50.83000183105469, "join_mode": "open", "created": 1366488509000, "group_lon": 4.329999923706055, "urlname": "BoardgamersBXL_new", "id": 8147602}, "description": "<p>This evening we'll be playing Yspahan.

know the Sinterklaas tradition. I will not bore you with all the details, but basically there is this guy that supposedly comes from Spain and each year brings gifts to children that behave well. (If you don't behave well - they put you in a bag and take you to Spain).</p> <p>Regardless of the story behind it, I always like this holiday, because it's an opportunity to come together in combination with a gift giving tradition.</p> <p>The adult version in the Netherlands goes usually like this. You bring together a group of people and you write on a piece of paper your name and what you would like to have. You then shuffle the basket, and every one picks one piece of paper (you have to redraw if you pick yourself).</p> <p>Then, you have a couple weeks to make a suprise (we pronounce it differently 'supreezuh') usually from papier-mache (some examples can be found here:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.google.be/search?q=sinterklaas+surprise&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=uC4&amp;rls=org.mozilla:nl:official&amp;channel=fflb&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l14-VIGABufN7Qaax4GoDA&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1055&amp;bih=739\"><a href=\"https://www.google.be/search?q=sinterklaas+surprise&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=uC4&amp;rls=org.mozilla:nl:official&amp;channel=fflb&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l14-VIGABufN7Qaax4GoDA&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1055&amp;bih=739\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.google.be/search?q=sinterklaas+surprise&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=uC4&amp;rls=org.mozilla:nl:official&amp;channel=fflb&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=l14-VIGABufN7Qaax4GoDA&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1055&amp;bih=739</a></a></p> <p>), in which you hide the present. Usually people also write poems to accompany this present, these poems are usually about the person receiving the gift. On Sinterklaasavond (around 5th of December) you come together, have a night full of Sinterklaas candy and gift each other thesesuprises.</p> <p><b>Sinterklaas party</b></p> <p>For the Sinterklaas party we will only do the gift giving part (but you can make a poem - if you want).</p> <p>1) Sign up and bring a <b>one or multiple wrapped gift(s)</b> with total value of about 5 euro.</p> <p>2) We will play a game with dice to decide who gets which present. It is possible you will go home with multiple present, or with none.</p> <p><br/>I'll provide drinks and Sinterklaas-snacks :).</p>", "created": 1413374809000, "rsvp_limit": 12, "venue": {"city": "Ixelles", "name": "Shirley's place", "repinned": false, "lon": 4.37158, "address_1": "10 min walk from Place Flagey", "country": "be", "lat": 50.828201, "id": 19431432}, "updated": 1413396490000, "visibility": "public", "yes_rsvp_count": 7, "time": 1417890600000, "duration": 10800000, "waitlist_count": 0, "headcount": 0, "maybe_rsvp_count": 0, "id": "213560512", "name": "Sinterklaas party"}]

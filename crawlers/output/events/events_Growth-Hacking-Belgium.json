See it as a Growth Hacking Meetup on steroids.</p> <p><br/>The goal is to accelerate the growth and scaling of startups that are in the \"product/market fit\" stage using a monthly iterative build-measure-learn process.</p> <p>We invite the selected startups to have a peer-to-peer review of THEIR products, landing pages and growth strategy done live on stage to the benefit of all growth hackers and growth engineers.</p> <p>Each team will have 5 minutes to talk about\u00a0&lt;b style=\"font-size : 16px\"&gt;one</b>\u00a0growth (hacking) issue they are facing, and to ask\u00a0&lt;b style=\"font-size : 16px\"&gt;one</b>\u00a0question to the rest of the teams. Then, for 12 minutes the entire group\u00a0-\u00a0led by Leo Exter &amp; myself - will brainstorm possible answers to the benefit (and learning) of the audience creating an unfair advantage for all circle members.</p> <p><br/>There are two conditions to secure your seat:</p> <p><br/>1.\u00a0You must have an up-and-running software or web service product that generates a minimal traffic of 20 unique visitors per day</p> <p>2.\u00a0You must register your project on\u00a0<a href=\"http://westartup.eu/\"><a href=\"http://westartup.eu\" class=\"linkified\">http://westartup.eu</a></a>\u00a0and send an email to\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:leo@westartup.eu\">leo@westartup.eu</a>\u00a0and &lt;a&gt;omar.mohout@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt; once you\u2019ve done that with the link to your project allowing us to assess your application</p> <p>You get an approval confirmation if you are selected to enter the circle.

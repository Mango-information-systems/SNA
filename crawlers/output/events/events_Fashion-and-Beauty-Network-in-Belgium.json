To find yours, take a long brush or pencil and hold it parallel to the outside edge of the colored part of your eye (the iris). Where the brush meets the brow is where the highest part of your brow should be. Finally tweeze the hairs underneath the arch.</p> <p>Don't forget to like Style me Fab.net on Facebook (<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/Stylemefab.net\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.facebook.com/Stylemefab.net</a>)</p> <p>How does \u00abShopping Made Fun\u00bb work?<br/>* Each shopping trip is open to 3 women only so you get plenty of my personal attention and shop with women who are feeling the same like you.<br/>* This season only two shopping trips will be available (be sure to register right away.
